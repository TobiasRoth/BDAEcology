In this first part, we present some fundamental material of statistics and data analysis, and R-specific issues that we regularly encounter during data analyses. This is also a commented collection of R-code that we documented for our own work. We hope this might be useful also for other readers.


## Further reading
- [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) is an introduction and manual for basic R usage.

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/spreadsheets): Introduces the tidyverse framework, explains how to get data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it.

There is a lot of online material to learn how to produce nice graphics with R, here some tips by a colleague of ours (who does not think it is necessary to mention his name here, but thanks, Steffen!):    


For plotting, here are some resources:

- The [ggplot2-book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) introduces the background of ggplots. It is the reference to consult for getting an understanding on how ggplot works.

- The [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) is a user-friendly look-up sheet providing a lot of example code. 

- [This](https://bookdown.org/content/b298e479-b1ab-49fa-b83d-a57c2b034d49/) is the book to the R graph gallery mentioned above. 
 
- And here is another [graphics book](https://r-graphics.org/)
