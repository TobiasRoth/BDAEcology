THIS CHAPTER IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!! 

## Introduction

The prior is an integral part of a Bayesian model. We must specify one.  

When to use informative priors: in applied research, when information from two different data sets should be combined.

when using non-informative priors: in basic reasearch when results should only report the information in the current data set.
