@article{Aebischer.1995,
 abstract = {Recent changes in British hunting legislation have protected the stock dove Columba oenas since 1 October 1982, and removed protection from the collared dove Streptopelia decaocto after 1 April 1977; the woodpigeon Columba palumbus has remained legal quarry throughout. Ringing recoveries offer a means of comparing annual survival rates before and after the change in legislation. Care is needed in the construction of the recovery matrices to remove inhomogeneities in the data and ensure that each 'year' runs from the day of legislative change. Annual survival rates were estimated by maximum likelihood using multinomial models conditioned on the recoveries; there was no evidence of age- or time-related variation in reporting rates. The annual survival rate of the stock dove was constant, at 54 +/- 3{\%}. For both the collared dove and the woodpigeon, estimates of survival rates in the first year after ringing were not consistent between birds ringed as young and those ringed as adults, but nevertheless averaged less before 1977 than after 1977; annual survival rates of birds that survived the first year after ringing did not differ between time periods, and were 64 +/- 2{\%} for the collared dove and 61 +/- 2{\%} for the woodpigeon. The proportion of recoveries reported shot or trapped was only 14{\%} for the collared dove, compared with 79{\%} for the woodpigeon, and remained constant before and after 1977 for both species; in the case of the stock dove, the proportion reported shot or trapped before and after 1982 fell from 70{\%} to 34{\%}. The change in quarry status had no effect on annual survivorship or population size of either the stock dove or the collared dove, while the woodpigeon has increased regularly in abundance despite heavy shooting.},

@article{Alerstam.2003,
 abstract = {Long-distance migration has evolved in many organisms moving through different media and using various modes of locomotion and transport. Migration continues to evolve or become suppressed as shown by ongoing dynamic and rapid changes of migration patterns. This great evolutionary flexibility may seem surprising for such a complex attribute as migration. Even if migration in most cases has evolved basically as a strategy to maximise fitness in a seasonal environment, its occurrence and extent depend on a multitude of factors. We give a brief overview of different factors (e.g. physical, geographical, historical, ecological) likely to facilitate and/or constrain the evolution of long-distance migration and discuss how they are likely to affect migration. The basic driving forces for migration are ecological and biogeographic factors like seasonality, spatiotemporal distributions of resources, habitats, predation and competition. The benefit of increased resource availability will be balanced by costs associated with the migratory process in terms of time (incl. losses of prior occupancy advantages), energy and mortality (incl. increased exposure to parasites). Furthermore, migration requires genetic instructions (allowing substantial room for learning in some of the traits) about timing, duration and distance of migration as well as about behavioural and physiological adaptations (fuelling, organ flexibility, locomotion, use of environmental transport etc) and control of orientation and navigation. To what degree these costs and requirements put constraints on migration often depends on body size according to different scaling relationships. From this expos{\'e} it is clear that research on migration warrants a multitude of techniques and approaches for a complete as possible understanding of a very complex evolutionary syndrome. In addition, we also present examples of migratory distances in a variety of taxons. In recent years new techniques, especially satellite radio telemetry, provide new information of unprecedented accuracy about journeys of individual animals, allowing re-evaluation of migration, locomotion and navigation theories.},

@article{Alerstam.2008,
 abstract = {Birds can save distance and time on their migratory journeys by following great circles rather than rhumblines, but great-circle routes require more complex orientation with changing courses. Flight directions at different places along the route and in relation to the destination can be used to test whether birds migrate along great circles or rhumblines. Such data have indicated great-circle migration among shorebirds at high latitudes, but no critical tests have been made for passerines. Using tracking radar on board the icebreaker Oden in August 2005, we recorded westerly flight directions of passerine migrants over the Chukchi Sea. The main sector of migratory directions was 237-311 degrees centered oil a mean heading direction of 274 degrees. The most likely species to participate in this westward trans-Beringia migration, mainly departing from Alaska, were Eastern Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla Ischutschensis), Arctic Warbler (Phylloscopus borealis kennicotti), Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), and Bluethroat (Luscinia svecica); all except the Bluethroat were recorded from the ship. Observed flight directions agreed with predicted great-circle courses but not with rhumbline courses for three of these four species with winter quarters in Southeast Asia; no definite conclusion could be drawn for the Northern Wheatear (wintering in East Africa). These results support great-circle migration among passerines traveling between Alaska and Old World winter quarters, though the long-distance precision and orientation mechanisms are Still unknown. The relative importance of different evolutionary causes-such as circumvention of geographic barriers, retracing of ancient colonization ways, or distance reduction by great-circle migration-to complex bird migration routes with changing courses remains to be understood.},

@article{Amrhein.2010,
 abstract = {1. In territorial contests, not only acoustic or other signals, but also the movements of a territorial

intruder are likely to influence the response of a resident.

2. We tested this movement hypothesis by simulating moving vs. stationary intruders into the territories

of winter wrens Troglodytes troglodytes, using the same non-interactive song playbacks in

both treatments.

3. Male winter wrens showed a different long-term singing reaction in response to a moving than

to a stationary intruder.

4. One day after experiencing an intruder that was switching between three locations, residents

started to sing earlier before sunrise, and they sang more and longer songs at dawn than before the

intrusion.

5. Residents receiving the same playback from one location only reacted by starting to sing later

relative to sunrise, and by singing fewer and shorter songs than before the intrusion.

6. We could not discriminate between the treatments when examining the short-term singing reactions

during and immediately after the playbacks. However, our results clearly demonstrate an

effect of the spatial behaviour of territorial intruders on the long-term territory defence of residents

at dawn, about 24 h after an intrusion.

7. We argue that spatial behaviour of territorial intruders should be an integral part of the study

of animal territory defence behaviour. Investigating long-term changes in territory defence at dawn

is a sensitive tool for discriminating between different types of intruders},

@article{Ancona.2017,
 abstract = {Adult sex ratio (ASR, the proportion of males in the adult population) is a central concept in population and evolutionary biology, and is also emerging as a major factor influencing mate choice, pair bonding and parental cooperation in both human and non-human societies. However, estimating ASR is fraught with difficulties stemming from the effects of spatial and temporal variation in the numbers of males and females, and detection/capture probabilities that differ between the sexes. Here, we critically evaluate methods for estimating ASR in wild animal populations, reviewing how recent statistical advances can be applied to handle some of these challenges. We review methods that directly account for detection differences between the sexes using counts of unmarked individuals (observed, trapped or killed) and counts of marked individuals using mark-recapture models. We review a third class of methods that do not directly sample the number of males and females, but instead estimate the sex ratio indirectly using relationships that emerge from demographic measures, such as survival, age structure, reproduction and assumed dynamics. We recommend that detection-based methods be used for estimating ASR in most situations, and point out that studies are needed that compare different ASR estimation methods and control for sex differences in dispersal.This article is part of the themed issue 'Adult sex ratios and reproductive decisions: a critical re-examination of sex differences in human and animal societies'.},

Using a 19-year study on Montagu's harrier, we report a long-term increase in boldness towards humans during nest visits. The probability of females fleeing or being passive during nest visits decreased, while defence intensity steadily increased over the study period. These behavioural responses towards humans were significantly repeatable. The phenotypic composition of the breeding population changed throughout the study period (4-5 harrier generations), with a gradual disappearance of shy individuals, leading to a greater proportion of bolder ones and a more behaviourally homogeneous population. We further show that nest visit frequency increased nest failure probability and reduced productivity of shy females, but not of bold ones. Long-term research or conservation programmes needing nest visits can therefore lead to subtle but relevant population compositional changes that require further attention.},

 abstract = {Effective population size (N(e)) is a key parameter to understand evolutionary processes and the viability of endangered populations as it determines the rate of genetic drift and inbreeding. Low Ne can lead to inbreeding depression and reduced population adaptability. In this study, we estimated contemporary N(e) using genetic estimators (LDNE, ONeSAMP, MLNE and CoNe) as well as a demographic estimator in a natural insular house sparrow metapopulation. We investigated whether population characteristics (population size, sex ratio, immigration rate, variance in population size and population growth rate) explained variation within and among populations in the ratio of effective to census population size (N(e)/N(c)). In general, N(e)/N(c) ratios increased with immigration rates. Genetic N(e) was much larger than demographic N(e), probably due to a greater effect of immigration on genetic than demographic processes in local populations. Moreover, although estimates of genetic N(e) seemed to track N(c) quite well, the genetic N(e) -estimates were often larger than Nc within populations. Estimates of genetic N(e) for the metapopulation were however within the expected range ({\textless}N(c)). Our results suggest that in fragmented populations, even low levels of gene flow may have important consequences for the interpretation of genetic estimates of N(e). Consequently, further studies are needed to understand how N(e) estimated in local populations or the total metapopulation relates to actual rates of genetic drift and inbreeding.},

 abstract = {Elevation has long been considered a major influence on the evolution of life-history traits. Most elevation-induced variation in life history traits has been attributed to changes in climate, duration of breeding season, predation, and food limitation. I use a phylogenetic approach to show that life histories are closely associated with breeding elevation in extant cardueline finches. Finches at high elevations had smaller clutches, fewer broods, and longer incubation periods. Neither food limitation nor nest predation appear to readily account for this strong elevational variation in cardueline life histories. However, juvenile survival may be greater at higher elevations as a result of prolonged parental care and shorter natal dispersal and can potentially compensate for reduced fecundity in high-elevation finches.},

 abstract = {Divergent selection on traits involved in both local adaptation and the production of mating signals can strongly facilitate population differentiation. Because of its links to foraging morphologies and cultural inheritance song of birds can contribute particularly strongly to maintenance of local adaptations. In two adjacent habitats--native Sonoran desert and urban areas--house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) forage on seeds that are highly distinct in size and shell hardness and require different bite forces and bill morphologies. Here, we first document strong and habitat-specific natural selection on bill traits linked to bite force and find adaptive modifications of bite force and bill morphology and associated divergence in courtship song between the two habitats. Second, we investigate the developmental basis of this divergence and find that early ontogenetic tissue transformation in bill, but not skeletal traits, is accelerated in the urban population and that the mandibular primordia of the large-beaked urban finches express bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) earlier and at higher level than those of the desert finches. Further, we show that despite being geographically adjacent, urban and desert populations are nevertheless genetically distinct corroborating findings of early developmental divergence between them. Taken together, these results suggest that divergent selection on function and development of traits involved in production of mating signals, in combination with localized learning of such signals, can be very effective at maintaining local adaptations, even at small spatial scales and in highly mobile animals.},

 abstract = {Data on Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix breeding success are presented for 1989, a good chick rearing year when 40{\%} of chicks survived to ten weeks, and compared with 1990, a poor year when only 28{\%} of chicks survived. This resulted in a mean of 2.7 juveniles per hen in 1989. In 1990, although mean brood size in July/August was similar to 1989, fewer hens had broods resulting in only 1.7 juveniles per hen. In 1989, estimates of breeding success from juvenile:adult ratios in shooting bags were only 4{\%} less than estimates using dogs. In 1989, breeding success was the same on areas with and without predator control. In 1990, the proportion of hens without broods more than trebled on areas without predator control, resulting in three times fewer juveniles per hen than on areas with predator control. A cock biased sex ratio of 1.6:1 was found in juveniles. Breeding success was higher than in most other British studies due to higher chick survival. Factors determing between-year differences in breeding success and their relevance to long-term declines in Britain are discussed.},

@article{Bairlein.1988,
 abstract = {During autumn 1985 European migrants were mist-netted at a stopover site in northern Algeria. Their body mass as well as subcutaneous fat depots were recorded. Trans-Saharan migrants were characterized by early occurence, medium to high body mass, moderate fat depots and they exhibites a well pronounced migratory fattening during their stopover periods. Migrants, however, which winter in the western Mediterranean area occured late and they showed normal body mass without subsequent fattening. The data support the recent assumption that many such trans-Saharan migrants cross northern Africa and, further on, the Sahara in stages rather than in one single long hop from northern Mediterranean sites to the southern edge of the desert. Moreover, these migrants seem to lay down much of their deopt fat for their furhter migration across the desert even in northwestern Africa. Therefore, stopover sithes in NW-Africa seem to be much more important for transSaharan migranst than proposed in view of the monstop crossing hypothesis which must be involved in preservation programmes for migratory birds.},

 abstract = {The northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) is a small (approx. 25 g), insectivorous migrant with one of the largest ranges of any songbird in the world, breeding from the eastern Canadian Arctic across Greenland, Eurasia and into Alaska (AK). However, there is no evidence that breeding populations in the New World have established overwintering sites in the Western Hemisphere. Using light-level geolocators, we demonstrate that individuals from these New World regions overwinter in northern sub-Sahara Africa, with Alaskan birds travelling approximately 14 500 km each way and an eastern Canadian Arctic bird crossing a wide stretch of the North Atlantic (approx. 3500 km). These remarkable journeys, particularly for a bird of this size, last between one to three months depending on breeding location and season (autumn/spring) and result in mean overall migration speeds of up to 290 km d(-1). Stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of winter-grown feathers sampled from breeding birds generally support the notion that Alaskan birds overwinter primarily in eastern Africa and eastern Canadian Arctic birds overwinter mainly in western Africa. Our results provide the first evidence of a migratory songbird capable of linking African ecosystems of the Old World with Arctic regions of the New World.},

@article{Balasubramaniam.2016,
 abstract = {Elevational gradients provide a powerful laboratory for understanding the environmental and ecological drivers of geographic variation in avian life-history strategies. Environmental variation across elevational gradients is hypothesized to select for a trade-off of reduced fecundity (lower clutch size and/or fewer broods) for higher offspring quality (larger eggs and/or increased parental care) in higher elevation species and populations. In birds, a focus on altricial species from north temperate latitudes has prevented an evaluation of the generality of this trade-off, and how it is affected by latitude and intrinsic factors (development mode). We performed a comparative analysis controlling for body size and phylogenetic relationships on a global data set of 135 galliform species to test (i) whether higher elevation precocial species have lower fecundity (smaller clutch and/or fewer broods) and invest more in offspring quality (greater egg mass) and (ii) whether latitude influences the traits involved and/or the trade-off, and (iii) to identify ecological and environmental drivers of life-history variation along elevational gradients. Life-history traits showed significant interaction effects across elevation and latitude: temperate higher elevation species had smaller clutches and clutch mass, larger eggs and shorter incubation periods, whereas more tropical species had larger clutches, eggs and clutch mass, and longer incubation periods as elevation increased. Number of broods and body mass did not vary with elevation or latitude. Latitudinal gradient in clutch size was observed only for low-elevation species. Significantly, an overlooked latitude-by-elevation interaction confounds our traditional view of clutch size variation across a tropical-to-temperate gradient. Across all latitudes, higher elevation species invested in offspring quality via larger eggs but support for reduced fecundity resulting from smaller clutches was found only along temperate elevational gradients; contrary to expectations, tropical high-elevation species showed increased fecundity. Variation in nest predation risk could explain differences between temperate and tropical elevational gradients, but we lack a consistent mechanism to explain why predation risk should vary in this manner. Alternatively, a resource availability hypothesis based on physical attributes that globally differ between elevation and latitude (seasonality in day length and temperature) seems more plausible.},

@article{Barve.2016,
 abstract = {Hypobaric hypoxia at high elevation represents an important physiological stressor for montane organisms, but optimal physiological strategies to cope with hypoxia may vary among species with different life histories. Montane birds exhibit a range of migration patterns; elevational migrants breed at high elevations but winter at low elevations or migrate further south, while high-elevation residents inhabit the same elevation throughout the year. Optimal physiological strategies to cope with hypoxia might therefore differ between species that exhibit these two migratory patterns, because they differ in the amount time spent at high elevation. We examined physiological parameters associated with blood-oxygen transport (haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit, i.e. the proportion of red blood cells in blood) in nine species of elevational migrants and six species of high-elevation residents that were sampled along a 2200 m (1000-3200 m) elevational gradient. Haemoglobin concentration increased with elevation within species regardless of migratory strategy, but it was only significantly correlated with haematocrit in elevational migrants. Surprisingly, haemoglobin concentration was not correlated with haematocrit in high-elevation residents, and these species exhibited higher mean cellular haemoglobin concentration than elevational migrants. Thus, alternative physiological strategies to regulate haemoglobin concentration and blood O2 carrying capacity appear to differ among birds with different annual elevational movement patterns.},

@article{Bellamy.2013,
 abstract = {* To manage anthropogenic environmental change for the benefit of biodiversity, we must improve our understanding of the complex relationships between organisms and their environment. We have developed multiscale habitat suitability models (HSMs) for bats, a mobile group of mammals, for a geographically varied region of the UK. We ask whether the models have sufficient accuracy to contribute to informed decision-making in habitat management and in minimizing the impact of climate change and human infrastructural development.




* We used acoustic surveys supplemented by catching to gather presence data for eight species from 30 sites across the south of the Lake District National Park in NW England. Species were identified by manual and automated extraction and analysis of echolocation calls. Fine-resolution (50 and 100~m) habitat maps were generated at twelve spatial scales by calculating the variables across squares of increasing size, from 100 to 6000~m, around each focal 50 or 100~m square. Presence-only HSM software, MaxEnt, was used to determine the predictive power of each habitat variable at each scale. Multiscale models included data for each variable at the scale at which it had the strongest relationship with the presence of each species.




* The best multiscale models were selected using fivefold cross-validation, with backwards, stepwise variable removal, whilst minimizing residual spatial autocorrelation and sampling bias. Further tests with independent field data indicated good model transferability across the entire National Park.




* Foraging bats were generally most strongly associated with variables measured at small spatial scales and distance measures. However, each species responded differently across the range of scales, and strong associations were also found at the largest scale of analysis (6000~m).




* Synthesis and applications. The best models for determining habitat suitability had few variables, making them easy to interpret and use in practical conservation planning. The approach is applicable to any taxa for which reliable presence records are available, providing insight into the potential impacts of land-use and environmental change. Maps identify areas of conservation concern, such as hot spots for diversity, rare or vulnerable species and potential or threatened network corridors, making them useful for ecological impact assessment of proposed developments, and to conservation managers planning habitat creation or improvement.},

 abstract = {Comparative studies about the relationships between vital rates and ecological traits at the community level are conspicuously lacking for most taxa because estimating vital rates requires detailed demographic data. Identifying relationships between vital rates and ecological traits could help to better understand ecological and evolutionary demographic mechanisms that lead to interspecific differences in vital rates. We use novel dynamic N-mixture models for counts to achieve this for a whole avian community comprising 53 passerine species, while simultaneously accounting for density dependence and environmental stochasticity in recruitment and survival and, importantly, correcting our inferences for imperfect detection. Demographic stochasticity is taken into account in the form of the binomial and Poisson distributions describing survival events and number of recruits. We then explore relationships between estimated demographic parameters (i.e., vital rates) and ecological traits related to migration patterns, diet, habitat and nesting location of each species. The relative importance of recruitment and adult survival as contributors to population growth varied greatly among species, and interspecific differences in vital rates partly reflected differences in ecological traits. Migratory mode was associated with interspecific differences in population growth and density dependence. Resident species had higher population growth rates than long- and short-distance migrants. We found no relationships between diet and population growth rate. Habitat differences were associated with different growth rates: alpine, wetland and farmland species had lower population growth rates than forest species. Differences in population growth rates among nesting locations showed that breeding habitat is essential for population dynamics. Our study reveals relationships between ecological traits and contributions of vital rates to population growth and suggests ways in which patterns of population growth fluctuations in a community might be determined by life history.},

@article{Benson.2014,
 abstract = {Large-scale adaptive radiations might explain the runaway success of a minority of extant vertebrate clades. This hypothesis predicts, among other things, rapid rates of morphological evolution during the early history of major groups, as lineages invade disparate ecological niches. However, few studies of adaptive radiation have included deep time data, so the links between extant diversity and major extinct radiations are unclear. The intensively studied Mesozoic dinosaur record provides a model system for such investigation, representing an ecologically diverse group that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for 170 million years. Furthermore, with 10,000 species, extant dinosaurs (birds) are the most speciose living tetrapod clade. We assembled composite trees of 614-622 Mesozoic dinosaurs/birds, and a comprehensive body mass dataset using the scaling relationship of limb bone robustness. Maximum-likelihood modelling and the node height test reveal rapid evolutionary rates and a predominance of rapid shifts among size classes in early (Triassic) dinosaurs. This indicates an early burst niche-filling pattern and contrasts with previous studies that favoured gradualistic rates. Subsequently, rates declined in most lineages, which rarely exploited new ecological niches. However, feathered maniraptoran dinosaurs (including Mesozoic birds) sustained rapid evolution from at least the Middle Jurassic, suggesting that these taxa evaded the effects of niche saturation. This indicates that a long evolutionary history of continuing ecological innovation paved the way for a second great radiation of dinosaurs, in birds. We therefore demonstrate links between the predominantly extinct deep time adaptive radiation of non-avian dinosaurs and the phenomenal diversification of birds, via continuing rapid rates of evolution along the phylogenetic stem lineage. This raises the possibility that the uneven distribution of biodiversity results not just from large-scale extrapolation of the process of adaptive radiation in a few extant clades, but also from the maintenance of evolvability on vast time scales across the history of life, in key lineages.},

As dissolution progresses, species diversity (number of species in the assemblage) decreases, but compound diversity (based on relative species abundance) first increases and then decreases; species dominance first decreases and then increases. The reason for these changes is that the species most susceptible to solution deliver moresediment to the ocean floor than do species with solution-resistant shells, possibly because the more soluble tests are produced in surface waters, where growth and production are greatest.},

@article{Berthold.1992,
 abstract = {THE Blackcap, Sylvia atricapilla, a widespread Palearctic migratory bird, rarely wintered in Britain until the 1950s. The winter population has since increased to several thousand birds1,2. Ringing indicates that these are not British Blackcaps forestalling migration, but birds breeding in Continental Europe reaching Britain on a novel westerly migration route3,4. The proportion of north-western migrants among Blackcaps ringed in parts of Germany and Austria has increased from 0{\%} before 1960 to currently 7--10{\%}5--7. We bred British wintering Blackcaps in captivity and determined the migratory direction of their offspring. Here we report that these birds migrate west-northwest in autumn, a direction genetically distinct from the British breeding population and the predominantly southwestern migratory population of west--central Europe. The novel route must have evolved within the past 30 years with selection favouring birds wintering some 1,500 km further north than most of their conspecifics. To our knowledge, this is the first case in any vertebrate in which a drastic and recent evolutionary change of behaviour has been documented and its genetic basis established.},

@article{Bertoglio.2018,
 abstract = {The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]MNI-659, selective for phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A), is a promising tool to assess an early biomarker for Huntington's disease (HD). In this study we investigated [18F]MNI-659 uptake in the Q175 mouse model of HD. Given the focal striatal distribution of PDE10A as well as the striatal atrophy occurring in HD, the spatial normalization approach applied during the processing could sensibly affect the accuracy of the regional quantification. We compared the use of a magnetic resonance images (MRI) template based on individual MRI over a PET and CT templates for regional quantification and spatial normalization of [18F]MNI-659 PET images. We performed [18F]MNI-659 PET imaging in six months old heterozygous (HET) Q175 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates, followed by X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan. In the same week, individual T2-weighted MRI were acquired. Spatial normalization and regional quantification of the PET/CT images was performed on MRI, [18F]MNI-659 PET, or CT template and compared to binding potential (BPND) using volumes manually delineated on the individual MR images. Striatal volume was significantly reduced in HET mice (-7.7{\%}, p{\textless}0.0001) compared to WT littermates. [18F]MNI-659 BPND in striatum of HET animals was significantly reduced (p{\textless}0.0001) when compared to WT littermates using all three templates. However, BPND values were significantly higher for HET mice using the PET template compared to the MRI and CT ones (p{\textless}0.0001), with an overestimation at lower activities. On the other hand, the CT template spatial normalization introduced larger variability reducing the effect size. The PET and CT template-based approaches resulted in a lower accuracy in BPND quantification with consequent decrease in the detectability of disease effect. This study demonstrates that for [18F]MNI-659 brain PET imaging in mice the use of an MRI-based spatial normalization is recommended to achieve accurate quantification and fully exploit the detectability of disease effect.},

 abstract = {1. Capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan mortality resulting from collisions with high tension power lines (11-420 kV) was estimated, based on the number of casualties found per kilometre of power line patrolled in three boreal forest and low alpine areas. 2. The length (km) of high tension power lines crossing tetraonid habitats was estimated using Geographical Information Systems and general knowledge about species-specific habitats. Of the entire Norwegian high tension power-line grid system (about 95 000 km), 55{\%} was estimated to cross capercaillie habitats, 56{\%} black grouse habitats and 16{\%} willow ptarmigan habitats. 3. Because of biasing factors related to data-collecting procedures, the number of collision victims found per kilometre of power line patrolled was increased by a factor varying from 6.0 to 14.9. The estimated losses were about 20 000, 26 000 and 50 000 for capercaillie, black grouse and willow ptarmigan, respectively, which are about 90{\%}, 47{\%} and 9{\%} of the annual hunting harvest of these species. 4. It was concluded that this estimating procedure may be useful to wildlife management authorities to assess losses caused by overhead wires in general. Locally, this mortality factor should be carefully recorded and considered together with other mortality factors like hunting, to avoid overexploitation.},

@article{Bieber.2012,
 abstract = {The timing of reproduction is one of the most crucial life history traits, with enormous consequences for the fitness of an individual. We investigated the effects of season and timing of birth on local survival probability in a small mammalian hibernator, the common dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius). Local monthly survival probability was lowest in the early active season (May--August, ϕadult = 0.75--0.88, ϕjuvenile = 0.61--0.68), increased during the late active season (August--October), and highest during hibernation (October--May, ϕadult = 0.96--0.98, ϕjuvenile = 0.81--0.94). Consequently, dormice had an extremely high winter survival probability. We observed two peaks in the timing of reproduction (June and August/September, respectively), with the majority of juveniles born late in the active season. Although early investment in reproduction seems the better life history tactic [survival probability until onset of reproduction: ϕborn early = 0.46, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.28--0.64; ϕborn late = 0.19, 95{\%} CI = 0.09--0.28], only females with a good body condition (significantly higher body mass) invest in reproduction early in the year. We suggest the high over-winter survival in dormice allows for a unique life history pattern (i.e., combining slow and fast life history tactics), which leads to a bimodal seasonal birth pattern: (1) give birth as early as possible to allow even the young to breed before hibernating, and/or (2) give birth as late as possible (leaving just enough time for these young to fatten) and enter directly into a period associated with the highest survival rates (hibernation) until maturity.},

@article{Billing.2012,
 abstract = {Inbreeding is common in small and threatened populations and often has a negative effect on individual fitness and genetic diversity. Thus, inbreeding can be an important factor affecting the persistence of small populations. In this study, we investigated the effects of inbreeding on fitness in a small, wild population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) on the island of Aldra, Norway. The population was founded in 1998 by four individuals (one female and three males). After the founder event, the adult population rapidly increased to about 30 individuals in 2001. At the same time, the mean inbreeding coefficient among adults increased from 0 to 0.04 by 2001 and thereafter fluctuated between 0.06 and 0.10, indicating a highly inbred population. We found a negative effect of inbreeding on lifetime reproductive success, which seemed to be mainly due to an effect of inbreeding on annual reproductive success. This resulted in selection against inbred females. However, the negative effect of inbreeding was less strong in males, suggesting that selection against inbred individuals is at least partly sex specific. To examine whether individuals avoided breeding with close relatives, we compared observed inbreeding and kinship coefficients in the population with those obtained from simulations of random mating. We found no significant differences between the two, indicating weak or absent inbreeding avoidance. We conclude that there was inbreeding depression in our population. Despite this, birds did not seem to actively avoid mating with close relatives, perhaps as a consequence of constraints on mating possibilities in such a small population.},

 abstract = {Patterns in life history phenomena may be demonstrated by examining wide ranges of body weight. Positive relationships exist between adult body size and the clutch size of poikilotherms, litter weight, neonate weight life span, maturation time and, for homeotherms at least, brood or gestation time. The complex of these factors reduces r max in larger animals or, in more physiological terms, r max is set by individual growth rate. Comparison of neonatal production with ingestion and assimilation suggests that larger mammals put proportionately less effort into reproduction. Declining parental investment and longer development times would result if neonatal weight is scaled allometrically to adult weight and neonatal growth rate to neonatal weight. Body size relations represent general ecological theries and therefore hold considerable promise in the development of predictive ecology.},

 abstract = {Reliable estimates of annual harvest rates are required for the implementation of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) adaptive harvest management decision frameworks. Because not all standard bands recovered during the hunting season are reported, band reporting probabilities are needed to estimate mallard harvest rates. Information from birds recovered with bands that notify finders of a reward (i.e., reward bands) can be used to estimate band reporting rates. We analyzed reward banding data for 3 stocks of mallards to estimate reporting probabilities that can be used to estimate harvest rates for birds recovered with toll-free or web-address bands. Specifically, we explored spatial variability in reporting probabilities, and assessed whether reporting probabilities varied among years. Our analysis indicated that reporting probabilities varied among the 4 Flyways, eastern Canada, and western Canada and Alaska. We had difficulty interpreting temporal fluctuations and found little evidence for any meaningful trends in reporting rates between 2002 and 2010. We recommend that reporting probabilities of 0.67 in the Atlantic Flyway, 0.81 in the Mississippi Flyway, 0.70 in the Central Flyway, 0.76 in the Pacific Flyway, 0.50 in eastern Canada, and 0.57 in western Canada and Alaska be used to estimate harvest probabilities for birds recovered in these regions},

@article{Both.2010,
 abstract = {During the past decades, phenology of many organisms has advanced in response to climate change [1]. Earlier arrival of long-distance migrants has been reported frequently [2, 3], but advancements of arrival and breeding were not always sufficient to match phenology at other trophic levels [4]. This has led to increased selection for early breeding [5] and severe population declines [6, 7]. This inadequate response has been explained by an inflexible start of migration, governed by cues unrelated to climate change, such as photoperiod [8]. It has been suggested that evolution at the genetic level is required for a change in photoresponsiveness [9]. Recently, such an evolutionary change in migration timing was suggested [10]. Here I show that timing of spring migration of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) has responded flexibly to climate change. Recovery dates during spring migration in Northern Africa advanced by ten days between 1980 and 2002, which was explained by improving Sahel rainfall and a phenotypic effect of birth date. The lack of advance on the breeding grounds most likely was due to environmental constraints during migration. Adjustment of arrival date in migrants to climate change could thus be rapid, but only if circumstances favorably change for the whole journey.},

@article{Botsch.2017,
 abstract = {The worldwide increase in human outdoor activities raises concerns for wildlife. Human disturbances, even at low levels, are likely to impact species during sensitive periods of the annual cycle. However, experimental studies during the putative sensitive period of territory establishment of birds which not only investigate low disturbance levels, but which also exclude the effect of habitat modification (e.g. walking trails) are lacking. Here, we experimentally disturbed birds in forest plots by walking through twice a day during territory establishment. Later we compared the breeding bird community of experimentally disturbed plots with that of undisturbed control plots. We discovered that the number of territories (-15.0{\%}) and species richness (-15.2{\%}) in disturbed plots were substantially reduced compared with control plots. Species most affected included those sensitive to human presence (assessed by flight-initiation distances), open-cup nesters and above-ground foragers. Long-distance migrants, however, were unaffected due to their arrival after experimental disturbance took place. These findings highlight how territory establishment is a sensitive period for birds, when even low levels of human recreation may be perceived as threatening, and alter settlement decisions. This can have important implications for the conservation of species, which might go unnoticed when focusing only on already established birds.},

@article{Boyle.2016,
 abstract = {Elevational gradients provide powerful natural systems for testing hypotheses regarding the role of environmental variation in the evolution of life-history strategies. Case studies have revealed shifts towards slower life histories in organisms living at high elevations yet no synthetic analyses exist of elevational variation in life-history traits for major vertebrate clades. We examined (i) how life-history traits change with elevation in paired populations of bird species worldwide, and (ii) which biotic and abiotic factors drive elevational shifts in life history. Using three analytical methods, we found that fecundity declined at higher elevations due to smaller clutches and fewer reproductive attempts per year. By contrast, elevational differences in traits associated with parental investment or survival varied among studies. High-elevation populations had shorter and later breeding seasons, but longer developmental periods implying that temporal constraints contribute to reduced fecundity. Analyses of clutch size data, the trait for which we had the largest number of population comparisons, indicated no evidence that phylogenetic history constrained species-level plasticity in trait variation associated with elevational gradients. The magnitude of elevational shifts in life-history traits were largely unrelated to geographic (altitude, latitude), intrinsic (body mass, migratory status), or habitat covariates. Meta-population structure, methodological issues associated with estimating survival, or processes shaping range boundaries could potentially explain the nature of elevational shifts in life-history traits evident in this data set. We identify a new risk factor for montane populations in changing climates: low fecundity will result in lower reproductive potential to recover from perturbations, especially as fewer than half of the species experienced higher survival at higher elevations.},

@article{Braunisch.2013b,
 abstract = {Confining biodiversity conservation to protected areas can be insufficient in human-dominated landscapes, particularly when aiming at the conservation of species with specific habitat require- ments covering large expanses. Such species can oſten only persist in a metapopulation struc- ture, which requires an extensive network of functionally interacting sites to ensure persistence, dynamics and connectivity of the population. The Capercaillie is strongly affected by habitat loss and fragmentation in Central Europe and has suffered from a century of severe population declines in the Black Forest (southwestern Germany). To countervail this trend, an area-wide action plan was developed; targeting the maintainance of a long-term viable population and addressing all causes known to play a role in the decline of the species. First, data from species monitoring and population genetics were used in combination with spatial modelling of habitat and habitat connectivity to identify and prioritize all areas relevant for long-term metapopulation persistence. The results provided the spatial framework for the action plan. Second, an extensive set of measures was defined, including habitat improvement, tourism management, predator control and guidelines for infrastructure development. The measures were developed based on scientific knowledge and practical experience in collaboration with all responsible stakeholder groups, which are also in part responsible for the implementation. The action plan is further complemented by training courses for practitioners, public relations, success control, species and habitat monitoring and research. By defining priority areas and measures for species conserva- tion both inside and outside of the designated protected areas, the action plan provides a basis for integrating conservation aims in regular land use and landscape planning. Given the role of Capercaillie as an umbrella species, this concept is also expected to support overall biodiversity of the high montane regions of the Black Forest.},

@article{Briefer.2010,
 abstract = {In songbirds, song complexity and song sharing are features of prime importance for territorial defence and mate attraction. These aspects of song may be strongly influenced by changes in social environment caused by habitat fragmentation. We tested the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation induced by human activities influences song complexity and song sharing in the skylark, a songbird with a very large repertoire and whose population recently underwent a large decline. We applied powerful mathematical and statistical tools to assess and compare song complexity and song sharing patterns of syllables and sequences of syllables in two populations: a declining population in a fragmented habitat, in which breeding areas are separated from each other by unsuitable surroundings, and a stable population in a continuous habitat. Our results show that the structure of the habitat influences song sharing, but not song complexity. Neighbouring birds shared more syllables and sequences of syllables in the fragmented habitat than in the continuous one. Habitat fragmentation seems thus to have an effect on the composition of elements in songs, but not on the number and complexity of these elements, which may be a fixed feature of song peculiar to skylarks.},

@article{Brlik.2019,
 abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass {\textless}100~g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

 abstract = {Ringing recoveries show differences in the recruiting areas and intermediate goal areas of migrants found in the lowlands and in the Alps, respectively. Surveillance-radar studies give a large-scale picture of migratory directions along the northern border of the Alps. Tracking radars yield complementary information on directions for different heights and selected sites. Differences in the volume of migration in the lowlands, at the first ridges of the Alps, and at an Alpine pass are revealed, as well as the behavior of migrants approaching mountain ridges of different appearance. The number of captured birds of different species can be explained according to estimates of populations in the recruiting areas, direction of migration, habitat preferences, diurnal migratory activity, and weather. Data gathered from captured birds reveal specific differences in the seasonal course of migration in the lowlands and the Alps, in the weight and age structures, in habitat shift, and in food selection.},

 abstract = {The need to monitor trends in biodiversity raises many technical issues. What are the features of a good biodiversity index? How should trends in abundance of individual species be estimated? How should composite indices, possibly spanning very diverse taxa, be formed? At what spatial scale should composite indices be applied? How might change-points--points at which the underlying trend changes--be identified? We address some of the technical issues underlying composite indices, including survey design, weighting of the constituent indices, identification of change-points and estimation of spatially varying time trends. We suggest some criteria that biodiversity measures for use in monitoring surveys should satisfy, and we discuss the problems of implementing rigorous methods. We illustrate the properties of different composite indices using UK farmland bird data. We conclude that no single index can capture all aspects of biodiversity change, but that a modified Shannon index and the geometric mean of relative abundance have useful properties.},

 abstract = {Bees are a key component of biodiversity as they ensure a crucial ecosystem service: pollination. This ecosystem service is

nowadays threatened, because bees suffer from agricultural intensification. Yet, bees rarely benefit from the measures

established to promote biodiversity in farmland, such as agri-environment schemes (AES). We experimentally tested if the

spatio-temporal modification of mowing regimes within extensively managed hay meadows, a widespread AES, can

promote bees. We applied a randomized block design, replicated 12 times across the Swiss lowlands, that consisted of three

different mowing treatments: 1) first cut not before 15 June (conventional regime for meadows within Swiss AES); 2) first cut

not before 15 June, as treatment 1 but with 15{\%} of area left uncut serving as a refuge; 3) first cut not before 15 July. Bees

were collected with pan traps, twice during the vegetation season (before and after mowing). Wild bee abundance and

species richness significantly increased in meadows where uncut refuges were left, in comparison to meadows without

refuges: there was both an immediate (within year) and cumulative (from one year to the following) positive effect of the

uncut refuge treatment. An immediate positive effect of delayed mowing was also evidenced in both wild bees and honey

bees. Conventional AES could easily accommodate such a simple management prescription that promotes farmland

biodiversity and is likely to enhance pollination services.},

Here, we standardize and synthesise the current data, assess the contribution of molecular research to the study of bat species and highlight the importance of its continued and expanded use. At an inter-population level, molecular studies have demonstrated a great diversity of population genetic structure within the order. Among populations of migratory species, genetic structure appears universally low, and hence seasonal movement is likely to be the prevailing influence. However, for sedentary species an array of factors including dispersal ability, extrinsic barriers to gene flow and historical events may determine the extent of genetic partitioning among populations. Intrinsic factors such as wing morphology or roost requirements may also influence population genetic structure in sedentary bat species, a proposal which requires further research. Molecular studies have also made important contributions towards an understanding of social organisation in bats. Evidence indicates that in many polygynous species male mating success does not translate directly into reproductive success, perhaps as a result of multiple mating by females. Estimates of relatedness within and genetic structure among colonies are, in general, very low; a finding which has important implications regarding theories concerning the formation and persistence of bat social groups. Molecular studies have provided new and important insights into the ecology of bats, and have opened up exciting and previously unexplored avenues of research. The data from these studies suggest not only a predictive framework for future studies, but also the use of genetic data in the management and conservation of bat species.},

 abstract = {The number of male Pochard per 100 females varied from 300 at 57° to 75 at 37° North throughout its European and North African range. Sex ratio bias related to long term  mean January temperatures was also found, but as temperature is correlated with latitude, these results cannot be used to reject any of three hypothees (cold tolerance, breeding advantage and intersexual competittion) put forward to explaoin differential migration. However, studies of breding biology and habitat use of duck species offer greater suppeort for the intersexual competition hypothesis.

 The survey indicatee that the sex ratio in theis speices is male biased, and suggesteed that the overall sex ratio lies between 140 and 230 males per 100 females. As sex ratios are near unity at hatching, females must suffer significantly higher mortality at some stage during development or adulthood. It hast been suggested that adult female mortality may be particularly high during autumn migration and the winter season (Owen {\&} Dix 1986) and that this is likely to be responsible for the disparity. There may also be an effect of higher hunting pressure at the southern end of the range where females winter predominantly.},

@article{Carey.2009,
 abstract = {Organisms living today are descended from ancestors that experienced considerable climate change in the past. However, they are currently presented with many new, man-made challenges, including rapid climate change. Migration and reproduction of many avian species are controlled by endogenous mechanisms that have been under intense selection over time to ensure that arrival to and departure from breeding grounds is synchronized with moderate temperatures, peak food availability and availability of nesting sites. The timing of egg laying is determined, usually by both endogenous clocks and local factors, so that food availability is near optimal for raising young. Climate change is causing mismatches in food supplies, snow cover and other factors that could severely impact successful migration and reproduction of avian populations unless they are able to adjust to new conditions. Resident (non-migratory) birds also face challenges if precipitation and/or temperature patterns vary in ways that result in mismatches of food and breeding. Predictions that many existing climates will disappear and novel climates will appear in the future suggest that communities will be dramatically restructured by extinctions and changes in range distributions. Species that persist into future climates may be able to do so in part owing to the genetic heritage passed down from ancestors who survived climate changes in the past.},

 abstract = {Long-distance migrant passerines are well known to often display high levels of philopatry to breeding and wintering grounds. One could expect that similar selective pressures and similar navigation skills would result in their being faithful to stopover sites, a pattern that has been described for several populations of migratory waders and waterfowl. In this paper, we develop the argument that passerines should suffer from higher costs and receive lower benefits from stopover site faithfulness than waterfowl and waders. Based on Alerstam's (1979)ﾓoptimal drift strategyﾔ theory and other considerations, we predict that passerines should have lower stopover site fidelity than geese and waders, and that site faithfulness should decrease with increasing distance from either end of the migratory journey. We present results from a long-term study on the stopover ecology of migrant passerines in southern Portugal that support these predictions and show that, for species and populations that neither nest nor winter in this country, few individuals are faithful to the stopover site. On the other hand, populations that included individuals at (or near to) the start or the end of the migratory journey, had much higher return rates. We could not find any evidence that species linked to scarce habitats, such as wetlands, were more site faithful. Our results are in agreement with several other reports, but in apparent contrast to previous conclusions resulting from some studies involving Old World warblers. These differences are discussed and it is argued that there is no solid evidence to suggest that site fidelity should be important for passerines at stopovers far away from breeding or wintering grounds, meaning that there is a large within-individual variability in the precise migratory routes and stopover sequence used each year.},

@article{Cha.2018,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Excessive mitochondrial fission has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). Consequently, mitochondrial dynamics has been suggested to be a promising therapeutic target for Huntington's disease. Mitochondrial fission depends on recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria, and Mff (mitochondrial fission factor) is one of the key adaptor proteins for this process. Removal of Mff therefore greatly reduces mitochondrial fission. Here we investigate whether removal of Mff can mitigate HD-associated pathologies in HD transgenic mice (R6/2) expressing mutant Htt.

METHOD

We compared the phenotype of HD mice with and without Mff. The mice were monitored for lifespan, neurological phenotypes, Htt aggregate formation, and brain histology.

RESULTS

We found that HD mice lacking Mff display more severe neurological phenotypes and have shortened lifespans. Loss of Mff does not affect mutant Htt aggregation, but it accelerates HD pathology, including neuronal loss and neuroinflammation.

CONCLUSIONS

Our data indicate a protective role for mitochondrial fission in HD and suggest that more studies are needed before manipulation of mitochondrial dynamics can be applied to HD therapy.},

@article{Ciach.2018,
 abstract = {Global warming is considered as a phenomenon having a negative effect on animals living in cold climate. However, herbivorous species inhabiting cold zones may potentially benefit from increase of temperature as this influence duration of vegetation period and increase food resources. In this study, we analyze the impact of climate factors on the long-term dynamics of an isolated and unhunted population of the Tatra chamois Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica. The population growth rate, based on autumnal chamois counting carried out from 1957 to 2016, were correlated with a set of climatic variables. We tested the hypothesis that high temperatures in summer could have a positive impact on the population, since they influence vegetation growth, which ensure food resources. On the other hand, heavy falls of snow and long-lasting and deep snow cover could adversely affect the population by reducing population survival during the winter. The results of this study indicate that climatic variables best explaining the autoregressed population growth rate (from the autumn of year t-1 to the autumn of year t) were the mean summer temperature of year t-1: the population increase was greater following a warmer summer in year t-1 and, in lower extent, the total precipitation during winter: the population decrease was greater following a winter with heavy snowfall. Duration and thickness of snow cover have no negative effect on population growth rate. The results indicate that the population dynamic of the Tatra chamois is determined in the long term by weather conditions, mainly by temperature, when kids are birthing and growing. The results of this work highlight that climatic changes may be responsible for the population dynamic of high-mountain species. Climate warming may lead to increase in duration of vegetation period in cold climatic zones, what may in turn have positive effect on herbivorous species, which relay upon food resources limited by low temperatures within vegetation period.},

 abstract = {We recorded bat activity simultaneously at ground level and 30 m height using Anabat II bat detectors and Anabat ZCAIM recording units mounted on masts at seven sites of varying habitat type in eastern England. At the lower detectors 6194 passes were recorded; 90.02{\%} of calls were from Pipistrellus; 6.91{\%} were from Nyctalus/Eptesicus; 1.70{\%} were Myotis/Plecotus; 0.13{\%} were Barbastella and 1.24{\%} could not be determined to species. At the higher detectors 484 passes were recorded from Pipistrellus (65.08{\%}) and Nyctalus/Eptesicus (34.09{\%}) and 0.83{\%} were not determined to species. Total bat passes and the number of Pipistrellus passes were significantly higher on the lower detectors compared with the upper detectors. The difference between numbers of passes of Nyctalus/Eptesicus at the upper and lower detectors was not significant, despite proportionally more passes of these species being recorded at height. No extra species groups were recorded at height than were recorded at ground level except at one site where closed canopy broadleaved woodland surrounded the mast. Here, Nyctalus/Eptesicus species were recorded only at height. Overall, 28{\%} of Nyctalus/Eptesicus passes and 5{\%} of Pipistrellus passes were recorded exclusively at height, and not at ground level. Assessing bat activity levels from ground level detectors only can therefore be misleading, particularly when surveying high-flying species that are most likely to be at risk from wind turbine developments.},

@article{Corrochano.2018,
 abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic fatal neurodegenerative disorder. However, there is increasing evidence that HD is a pleiotropic systemic disorder. In particular, skeletal muscle metabolism is greatly affected in HD, which in turn can have a major impact on whole-body metabolism and energetic balance. Throughout an unbiased mutagenesis approach in HD mice, we have found that Scn4a, a skeletal muscle-specific sodium channel gene, is a modifier of the disease. Mutations in Scn4a enhance HD disease progression and weight loss by accelerating muscle waste and cachexia, increasing skeletal muscle activity and energy demands. At the molecular level, Scn4a mutations activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to a fibre switch towards more oxidative types. These adaptations seen in HD; Scn4a double mutant muscles are similar to those observed in healthy individuals after endurance exercise training regimes. This prompted us to assess the effects of an endurance exercise regime in HD mice, independently showing that skeletal muscle adaptations leading to the activation of AMPK are detrimental for HD pathogenesis. Although it is undeniable that physical exercise can lead to many health benefits, our work shows that, at least under certain situations such as in HD, an endurance exercise routine could be a detrimental therapeutic option.},

@article{Curtin.2015,
 abstract = {Huntington's Disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. In these experiments, we tested if operant training at an early age affected adult cognitive deficits in the zQ175 KI Het (zQ175) mouse model of HD. In Experiment 1 we trained zQ175 mice in a fixed-ratio/progressive ratio (FR/PR) task to assay learning and motivational deficits. We found pronounced deficits in response rates and task engagement in na{\"i}ve adult zQ175 mice (32-33 weeks age), while deficits in zQ175 mice trained from 6-7 weeks age were either absent or less severe. When those mice were re-tested as adults, FR/PR performance deficits were absent or otherwise less severe than deficits observed in na{\"i}ve adult zQ175 relative to wild type (WT) mice. In Experiment 2, we used a Go/No-go operant task to assess the effects of early cognitive testing on response inhibition deficits in zQ175 mice. We found that zQ175 mice that began testing at 7-8 weeks did not exhibit deficits in Go/No-go testing, but when re-tested at 28-29 weeks age exhibited an initial impairment that diminished with training. These transient deficits were nonetheless mild relative to deficits observed among adult zQ175 mice without prior testing experience. In Experiment 3 we trained mice in a two-choice visual discrimination test to evaluate cognitive flexibility. As in prior experiments, we found performance deficits were mild or absent in mice that started training at 6-9 weeks of age, while deficits in naive mice exposed to training at 28-29 weeks were severe. Re-testing mice at 28-29 weeks age, were previously trained starting at 6-9 weeks, revealed that deficits in learning and cognitive flexibility were absent or reduced relative to effects observed in naive adults. In Experiment 4, we tested working memory deficits with a delayed non-match to position (DNMTP) test. Mice with prior experience exhibited mild working memory deficits, with males zQ175 exhibiting no deficits, and females performing significantly worse than WT mice at a single delay interval, whereas naive zQ175 exhibited severe delay-dependent deficits at all intervals exceeding 1 s. In sum, these experiments indicate that CAG-dependent impairments in motivation, motor control, cognitive flexibility, and working memory are sensitive to the environmental enrichment and experience. These findings are of clinical relevance, as HD carrier status can potentially be detected at an early age.},

The most spectacular examples occur in insects where males increase their own chances of fertilizing the female's eggs by mate guarding, mating plugs and even removal of other males' sperm1,2. Here, sperm competition is described for a small European passerine bird, the dunnock (Prunella modularis), where females are often mated simultaneously to two males3,4 and where there is an elaborate pre-copulatory display5,6. It is shown that, during this display, the male stimulates the female to eject sperm before he himself copulates. The display is most intense where there is a high probability that another male has recently mated with the female.},

@article{Davis.2015,
 abstract = {Biodiversity elements with narrow niches and restricted distributions (i.e., 'short range endemics,' SREs) are particularly vulnerable to climate change. The New Mexico Ridge-nosed Rattlesnake (Crotalus willardi obscurus, CWO), an SRE listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act within three sky islands of southwestern North America, is constrained at low elevation by drought and at high elevation by wildfire. We combined long-term recapture and molecular data with demographic and niche modeling to gauge its climate-driven status, distribution, and projected longevity. The largest population (Animas) is numerically constricted (N = 151), with few breeding adults (Nb = 24) and an elevated inbreeding coefficient (\textgreek{D}F = 0.77; 100 years). Mean home range (0.07 km2) is significantly smaller compared to other North American rattlesnakes, and movements are within, not among sky islands. Demographic values, when gauged against those displayed by other endangered/Red-Listed reptiles [e.g., Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta)], are either comparable or markedly lower. Survival rate differs significantly between genders (female{\textless}male) and life history stages (juvenile{\textless}adult) while a steadily declining population trajectory (r = -0.20$\pm$0.03) underscores the shallow predicted-time-to-extinction (17.09$\pm$2.05 years). Core habitat is receding upwards in elevation and will shift 750 km NW under conservative climate estimates. While survival is significantly impacted by wildfire at upper elevations, the extinction vortex is driven by small population demographics, a situation comparable to that of the European Adder (Vipera berus), a conservation icon in southern Sweden. Genetic rescue, a management approach successfully employed in similar situations, is ill advised in this situation due to climate-driven habitat change in the sky islands. CWO is a rare organism in a unique environment, with a conserved niche and a predisposition towards extinction. It is a bellwether for the eventual climate-driven collapse of the Madrean pine-oak ecosystem, one of Earth's three recognized megadiversity centers.},

We measured oxygen consumption in an open flow system using a Beckman OM-14 oxygen analyzer at ambient temperatures range from -25℃ - 40℃, on the following species: Ersmophlla alpestris, Prunella rubeculoides, Passer montanus, Montifringilla ruficollis, Acanthis flavirostris,In all of species, the basal metabolic rate were 3.72-5.69 O2ml/g/h; the lower critical temperatures were 19.7°o-27.5℃; the upper critical temperatures were 28.5°-36.4℃. At 40℃, a extreme high temperature, 4 species of them occured dead samples; at - 25℃, the mean oxygen consumption increased further to about 3 times of basal metabolic rate.From the results which indicated the small birds in alpine meadow are well adapted to cold climates as subarctic birds, and evolved higher rates of metabolism, lower limits of temperature tolerability and greater capacities for mobilizing than lower altitude and southern species},

@article{Dennis.2017,
 abstract = {Appropriate large-scale citizen-science data present important new opportunities for biodiversity modelling, due in part to the wide spatial coverage of information. Recently proposed occupancy modelling approaches naturally incorporate random effects in order to account for annual variation in the composition of sites surveyed. In turn this leads to Bayesian analysis and model fitting, which are typically extremely time consuming. Motivated by presence-only records of occurrence from the UK Butterflies for the New Millennium data base, we present an alternative approach, in which site variation is described in a standard way through logistic regression on relevant environmental covariates. This allows efficient occupancy model-fitting using classical inference, which is easily achieved using standard computers. This is especially important when models need to be fitted each year, typically for many different species, as with British butterflies for example. Using both real and simulated data we demonstrate that the two approaches, with and without random effects, can result in similar conclusions regarding trends. There are many advantages to classical model-fitting, including the ability to compare a range of alternative models, identify appropriate covariates and assess model fit, using standard tools of maximum likelihood. In addition, modelling in terms of covariates provides opportunities for understanding the ecological processes that are in operation. We show that there is even greater potential; the classical approach allows us to construct regional indices simply, which indicate how changes in occupancy typically vary over a species' range. In addition we are also able to construct dynamic occupancy maps, which provide a novel, modern tool for examining temporal changes in species distribution. These new developments may be applied to a wide range of taxa, and are valuable at a time of climate change. They also have the potential to motivate citizen scientists.},

@article{Dietz.2006,
 abstract = {ABSTRACT We assessed effects of forearm bands on three species of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, R. euryale and R. mehelyi) marked for studies on regional movements and colony structure in Northern Bulgaria. Overall, more than 85{\%} of the 580 recaptured individuals showed no negative impact of the banding. We had to note, however, slight or severe injuries in 7.6 and 6.4{\%} of the bats, respectively. Injury rates varied greatly according to species and ring sizes. The use of the smaller of two tested ring sizes caused major injury rates of more than 60{\%} of the recaptured R. mehelyi. But even in R. ferrumequinum, for which we obtained the largest sample size, and for which the recommended ring size is well-established, carefully fitted forearm bands caused injuries in 9.3{\%} of the recaptures, an injury rate that is much higher than in most vespertilionid bat species. The main reason for the sensitivity of the horseshoe bats to ringing was that the ring rubbed raw the bats' propatagium; the resulting injuries led to growing scars and infections. We compare published and unpublished injury rates of 28 bat species with our results and discuss the use of alternative marking methods. We suggest that banding of horseshoe bats should be limited to well defined projects and only used if the study populations are in a good preservation condition and long term effects of the marking method can be monitored.},

@article{Dillingham.2008,
 abstract = {Many bird species are subject to human-caused mortality, either through direct harvest (e.g. game birds) or through incidental mortalities (e.g. fisheries-related bycatch of seabirds, impact with vehicles, wind turbines, or power lines). In order to assess the impact of additional mortalities on birds, both the number of birds killed and their ability to sustain those deaths must be estimated. Niel and Lebreton [Niel, C., Lebreton, J.-D., 2005. Using demographic invariants to detect overharvested bird populations from incomplete data. Conservation Biology 19, 826--835] applied a simple decision rule [Wade, P.R., 1998. Calculating limits to the allowable human-caused mortality of cetaceans and pinnipeds. Marine Mammal Science 14, 1--37] to estimate the level of additional human-caused mortality or potential biological removal (PBR) that can be sustained for bird species given only (1) estimates of the population size, adult survival, and age at first breeding, and (2) the current population status and management goals. We provide guidelines for appropriate use of the method and case studies comparing results from this method to other approaches. Particular focus is placed on applying the method to Procellariiformes.



PBR limits may then be set without a population model and when monitoring levels are minimal, and in a computationally straightforward manner. While this approach has many advantages, there are limitations. The PBR rule was initially developed for cetaceans and pinnipeds and there have been no adaptations for the unique biology of birds which may need further consideration. Additionally, because this is a simplifying method that ignores differences in life stages, it may not be appropriate for very small populations or for those listed as `critically endangered', and further work is needed for situations where mortalities have large gender or age bias.},

 abstract = {European Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus enter Africa along two routes: most of the western populations are channelled through northwest Africa in autumn and water across West Africa as far east as Nigeria; some central populations of nominate scirpaceus and birds of the eastern race fuscus migrate through northeast Africa, and winter in central and eastern Africa. Some birds stop over in northeast Africa and moult before arrival in winter quarters. Spring passage can take place across the central Sahara.


All populations of European Marsh Warblers Acrocephalus palustris migrate southeastwards through the Middle East and northeast Africa. They reach the Red Sea coast in August-September, then to four months in poorly located autumn quarters before resuming southward migration on a narrow front---almost entirely through eastern Kenya. A complete moult takes place in the winter quarters in southeastern Africa.


Both species inhabit dense green scrub or thickets with rank grass, but are largely allopatric. A. scirpaceus may locally prefer pure stands of tall rank grass; in the dry Sahel, it is also recorded from marshes. The winter habitat of A. palustris is somewhat similar to that in summer, but overall the herbaceous cover is less important for food and shelter.


Individual duration of moult, weight changes during migration and in winter, and site fidelity are also reviewed.},

 abstract = {Of the many problems posed by the phenomenon of bird migration, the interpretation of current migratory patterns in an evolutionary perspective remains a very thorny one. A widespread feature is for populations of the same species occupying distinctly disjunct breeding ranges to show differences in their wintering range as well. In some cases the more northerly breeding forms pass over the other populations to winter beyond the more southerly breeding forms. This migratory pattern, termed leap-frog migration, was first recognized more than 50 years ago and has been extensively discussed by Salomonsen (1955a,b), who in particular extended the list to include a number of waders. All authors who have grappled with this problem are in agreement that the displacement of the populations in winter must be attributed to the avoidance of competition (for review see Greenberg 1986). We accept this essential ingredient, and from this basic premise we will explore the implications of the spectacular differences in wintering area for the energy budgets of populations so segregated. In essence, we believe that pinpointing the essential differences in the energetic balance of the leap-frogging component may help to identify the selective advantages associated with the evolution of this migratory pattern.},

@article{Dufour.2018,
 abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal genetic neurological disorder caused by a mutation in the human Huntingtin (HTT) gene. This mutation confers a toxic gain of function of the encoded mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein, leading to widespread neuropathology including the formation of mHTT-positive inclusion bodies, gene dysregulation, reduced levels of adult dentate gyrus neurogenesis and neuron loss throughout many regions of the brain. Additionally, because HTT is ubiquitously expressed, several peripheral tissues are also affected. HD patients suffer from progressive motor, cognitive, psychiatric, and metabolic symptoms, including weight loss and skeletal muscle wasting. HD patients also show neuroendocrine changes including a robust, significant elevation in circulating levels of the glucocorticoid, cortisol. Previously, we confirmed that the R6/2 mouse model of HD exhibits elevated corticosterone (the rodent homolog of cortisol) levels and demonstrated that experimentally elevated corticosterone exacerbates R6/2 HD symptomology, resulting in severe and rapid weight loss and a shorter latency to death. Given that efficacious therapeutics are lacking for HD, here we investigated whether normalizing glucocorticoid levels could serve as a viable therapeutic approach for this disease. We tested the hypothesis that normalizing glucocorticoids to wild-type levels would ameliorate HD symptomology. Wild-type (WT) and transgenic R6/2 mice were allocated to three treatment groups: 1) adrenalectomy with normalized, WT-level corticosterone replacement (10 \textgreek{m}g/ml), 2) adrenalectomy with high HD-level corticosterone replacement (35 \textgreek{m}g/ml), or 3) sham surgery with no corticosterone replacement. Normalizing corticosterone to WT levels led to an improvement in metabolic rate in male R6/2 mice, as indicated by indirect calorimetry, including a reduction in oxygen consumption and normalization of respiratory exchange ratio values (p {\textless} .05 for both). Normalizing corticosterone also ameliorated brain atrophy in female R6/2 mice and skeletal muscle wasting in both male and female R6/2 mice (p {\textless} .05 for all). Female R6/2 mice given WT-level corticosterone replacement also showed a reduction in HD neuropathological markers, including a reduction in mHTT inclusion burden in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus (p {\textless} .05 for all). This data illustrates that ameliorating glucocorticoid dysregulation leads to a significant improvement in HD symptomology in the R6/2 mouse model and suggests that cortisol-reducing therapeutics may be of value in improving HD patient quality of life.},

Dulac (2010) Bilan de 3,5 ann{\'e}es de suivi de la mortalit{\'e} des chiropter{\`e}res sousl les {\'e}oliennes de Bouin (Vend{\'e}e). Symbioses 25 : 32-36.


Die untersuchten 8 WEA wurden 2003 ca. 500 m von der K{\"u}ste entfernt in einem Natura 2000-Gebiet erbaut. Die Masth{\"o}he ist 105 m, die Leistung 2.4 und 2.5 MW. Vor (ab 2000) und nach (bis 2006) dem Bau wurden die Auswirkungen der Anlagen auf V{\"o}gel untersucht. Im ersten Jahr, in dem nach toten V{\"o}geln gesucht wurden, wurden auch tote Flederm{\"a}use entdeckt. Diese wurden fortan ebenfalls systematisch erfasst. 

An jeder WEA wurde ein Quadrat von 100 x 100 m Gr{\"o}sse im Abstand von 8 m systematisch einmal pro Woche {\"u}ber das ganze Jahr abgesucht (Fig. 3). 4 Mal im Jahr (zu jeder Jahreszeit) wurden Schwundraten-Experimente sowie Sucheffiziez-Experimente durchgef{\"u}hrt. Wie genau die durchgef{\"u}hrt wurden, ist nicht erkl{\"a}rt, es ist auch keine Literaturangabe angegeben. Evt. w{\"u}rde man die detaillierten Beschreibungen im Schlussbericht des Projektes finden (Dulac 2008). Er schreibt jedoch, dass die Experimente daf{\"u}r bestimmt gewesen seien, um die Schwundrate und Auffindbarkeit von toten V{\"o}geln zu bestimmen. F{\"u}r Flederm{\"a}use h{\"a}tten sie jene Schwundraten und Sucheffizienzen verwendet, die f{\"u}r kleine V{\"o}gel (kleiner als Amseln) ermittelt worden seien.

Zus{\"a}tzlich wurde ein Fl{\"a}chenkorrekturfaktor ermittelt (es ist auch nicht ganz klar, wie dieser bestimmt wurde). Um von der Zahl gefundener Flederm{\"a}use auf die Zahl gestorbener hochzurechen, wurde die Zahl gefundener Flederm{\"a}use durch das Produkt aus Sucheffizienz, Verbleibrate und Anteil abgesuchter Fl{\"a}che geteilt. 

In den 3.5 Jahren Totfundnachsuchen wurden total 77 Flederm{\"a}use gefunden. Artenzusammensetzung ist in Tabelle 1 dargestellt. Von den 77 Flederm{\"a}usen wiesen nur 3 {\"a}usserliche Verletzungen auf (dies sein bei den V{\"o}geln ganz anders gewesen). Eine Zwergfledermaus, die in gutem Zustand war, wurde autopsiert und eine Lungenh{\"a}moragie (? h{\'e}moragie pulmonaire d'origine traumatique) festgestellt.  

91 {\%} der gefundenen Flederm{\"a}use wurden zwischen Juli und Oktober gefunden (Jahresverlauf in Fig. 5 und 6). Es wurden an allen 8 Anlagen tote Flederm{\"a}use gefunden, jedoch an 3 Anlagen im S{\"u}den des Parks deutlich h{\"a}ufiger (54{\%} der 77 Flederm{\"a}use wurden an diesen 3 Anlagen gefunden). Die Schwundratenexperimente ergaben, dass je nach Saison zwischen 25 und 67 {\%} der Kadaver innerhalb einer Woche verschwanden und 47 bis 57 {\%} der kleinen Kadaver wurden gefunden. Nach {\glqq}Anwendung der Korrektur{\grqq} (keine genaueren Angaben dar{\"u}ber, ob die Schwundraten und Sucheffizienzen {\"u}ber das Jahr gemittelt wurden oder ob pro Saison separat hochgerechnet wurde) wurden 0.9 -- 4.1 tote Flederm{\"a}use pro Woche an den 8 Anlagen gesch{\"a}tzt. Pro Jahr und (einer) Anlage wurden 6 bis 26.7 tote Flederm{\"a}use gesch{\"a}tzt. Tabelle 2: Die Zahlen sind Anzahl gestorbene Flederm{\"a}use pro Woche an den 8 Anlagen. Die Zahlen in den Klammern beziehen sich auf eine Anlage und ein Jahr.

Der hohe Anteil an Rauhautflederm{\"a}usen, die sonst im Gebiet nicht bekannt ist, zeigt, dass ziehende Arten st{\"a}rker betroffen sind als nicht-ziehende Arten. Dann folgen einige Literaturvergleiche.

Zuletzt werden einige Hypothesen augestellt, die noch zu testen sind:

Betreffend Pr{\"a}senz von Flederm{\"a}usen an WEAs:

- Weil Insekten durch WEA angezogen werden (W{\"a}rme, Licht), werden auch Flederm{\"a}use angezogen.

- Flederm{\"a}use werden durch WEA angezogen, weil sie Quartiere suchen.

- Die Rotoren erzeugen T{\"o}ne, deren Frequenz nahe bei jenen von grossen Insekten ist. Deshalb werden jagende Flederm{\"a}use angezogen.

- F{\"u}r den Park de Bouin: Wegen der K{\"u}stenn{\"a}he k{\"o}nnten ziehende Flederm{\"a}use konzentriert vorkommen.

- einfacher Zufall f{\"u}r ziehende Flederm{\"a}use

Betreffend Todesursachen:

- direkte Kollision mit dem Rotor

- direkte Kollision mit dem Masten

- Verwirblung durch Luftturbulenzen

- Barotrauma},

@article{Emmenegger.2018b,
 abstract = {Mobile hosts like birds occupy a wide array of habitats in which they encounter various vector and parasite faunas. If the infection probability for vector-borne parasites varies among seasons and biomes, a migratory life can critically influence the infections of a host. The growing body of literature on avian blood parasites suggests that host migrations do not only influence prevalence of infection but can also evoke higher infection intensities and increased parasite diversity in migrant compared to resident host species. We investigated the prevalence, intensity and diversity of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infections in three closely-related and sympatrically breeding sparrow species with different migration strategies ranging from residential house sparrow and partially migratory tree sparrow to the obligate migratory Spanish sparrow. With a prevalence of 49{\%}, the migratory Spanish sparrows were significantly less frequently infected than the resident house sparrows (82{\%}). The partially migratory tree sparrow showed an intermediate prevalence of 60{\%}. The parasitaemias were similar in all three host species and indicated mostly chronic but also few acute infections. While we found Plasmodium parasites in all three sparrow species, only Spanish sparrows were infected with Haemoproteus parasites in our study. With nine clearly identified parasite lineages in our study and the highest number of lineages per infected individuals (i.e. relative diversity), Spanish sparrows harboured the most diverse parasite fauna. Our results suggest that migration strategies can affect Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infections of sparrows resulting in a lower parasite prevalence and higher parasite diversity in migratory hosts-at least during our host's breeding period. A general scope for all annual cycle periods and across various bird taxa remains to be elucidated.},

 abstract = {Abstract We studied age-related variation in body mass and epididymal distension in male Daubenton's bats. Examination of data on epididymal distension in young of the year indicates that some reach sexual maturity by the year of birth, whereas others do so in their 2nd summer. Body mass and epididymal distension were positively correlated in young of the year and adults, suggesting that early sexual maturation and reproductive condition during later life are dependent on body condition. Older males tended to be heavier and in better reproductive condition than younger ones. Examination of our data suggests that physical and reproductive condition of males increase after the initial onset of fertility until 3 years of age. This late physical maturation is in line with other life-history traits characterizing long-lived bats as K-strategists among small mammals.},

@article{Entwistle.1998,
 abstract = {Observations of the external morphology of wild-caught and captive male brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus) revealed a marked seasonal pattern of spermatogenesis, similar to that established by histological examination of other temperate-zone vespertilionids, with a peak in testes size in August and a lag between testicular growth and epididymal distension. This was followed by complete cessation of spermatogenesis and shrinkage of the testes to prepubertal size. The period of peak spermatogenesis coincided with a reduction in the incidence of torpor and also a decline in body mass. This suggests that torpor and spermatogenesis may be incompatible in this species. Outside the season of testicular growth and epididymal distension, sexual maturity could not be confidently determined in P. auritus by the pigmentation of the tunica vaginalis surrounding the epididymis, a characteristic which has become established in other species. Instead, the size and shape of the caudae epididymides appeared to be a better criterion for defining sexual maturity in this species. Most males underwent testicular growth and epididymal distension, and were assumed to have reached sexual maturity, at an age of 15 months. However, some individuals (29{\%}), particularly those in good condition (relatively heavy individuals), showed a degree of testicular and epididymal development in their first autumn, i.e. at 3 months of age, indicating that the onset of puberty may be dependent on body condition. Poor body condition was associated with delayed spermatogenesis in adult males.},

@article{Entwistle.2000,
 abstract = {Brown long-eared bats Plecotus auritus occupying 30 summer roosts in north-east Scotland were studied over 15 years. During this time 1365 bats were ringed, and a further 720 recaptures were made. Individual bats showed a high degree of roost fidelity, returning to one main roost site; {\textless} 1{\%} of recaptured bats had moved among roost sites, and all recorded movements (n= 5) were {\textless} 300 m. Adults of both sexes were loyal to the roost sites at which they were first captured, indicating long-term use of roosts. At least some juveniles (n= 32) of both sexes returned to the natal roost. Mark--recapture estimates indicated that colonies of this species were substantially larger (c. 30--50 individuals) than assumed in previous studies. Plecotus auritus differs from most other temperate zone, vespertilionid species in that there was no evidence of sexual segregation during summer, with males present in all colonies throughout the period of occupancy. Population structure in summer seems to be consistent with a metapopulation model, with discrete sub-populations showing minimal interchange. The group size, colony composition and population structure described in this species may be associated with the wing shape (particularly aspect ratio) and foraging behaviour of P. auritus. It is postulated that relative motility, linked to wing structure, may affect the distribution of individuals, and may have implications for the genetic structure of this species. Correlations between aspect ratio and both colony size and migratory behaviour, across British bat species, indicate that wing shape could be an important factor contributing to patterns of social behaviour and genetic structuring in bats.},

 abstract = {AIM

Deficient glutamate reuptake occurs in the cerebral cortex of Huntington's disease (HD) patients and murine models. Here, we examine the effects of partial or complete blockade of glutamate transporters on excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs).

METHODS

Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CPNs in slices from symptomatic R6/2 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were used to examine the effects of selective or concurrent inhibition of glutamate reuptake transporters.

RESULTS

Selective inhibition of the glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) or the glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) produced slight decreases in decay time of evoked EPSCs in CPNs from WT and R6/2 mice with no significant differences between genotypes. In contrast, concurrent inhibition of both transporters with DL-TBOA induced a significant increase in area and decay time and this effect was significantly greater in R6/2 CPNs. Furthermore, full blockade also reduced spontaneous EPSC frequency and exacerbated epileptiform activity in CPNs from symptomatic R6/2 mice.

CONCLUSIONS

R6/2 CPNs are more sensitive to glutamate accumulation during full inhibition of both glutamate transporters, and these neurons have homeostatic mechanisms to cope with inhibition of GLT-1 or GLAST by a mechanism that involves upregulation of either transporter when the other is deficient.},

@article{Evangelista.2016,
 abstract = {High-mountain ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change, causing biodiversity loss, habitat degradation and landscape modifications. However, very few detailed studies have focussed on plant biodiversity in the high mountains of the Mediterranean. In this study, we investigated the long-term changes that have occurred in the composition, structure and ecology of high-mountain vegetation in the central Apennines (Majella) over the last 42 years. We performed a re-visitation study, using historical and newly collected vegetation data to explore which ecological and structural features have been the most successful in coping with climatic changes. Vegetation changes were analysed by comparing geo-referenced phytosociological relev{\'e}s collected in high-mountain habitats (dolines, gentle slopes and ridges) on the Majella massif in 1972 and in 2014. Composition analysis was performed by detrended correspondence analysis, followed by an analysis of similarities for statistical significance assessment and by similarity percentage procedure (SIMPER) for identifying which species indicate temporal changes. Changes in ecological and structural indicators were analysed by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance, followed by a post hoc comparison. Over the last 42 years, clear floristic changes and significant ecological and structural variations occurred. We observed a significant increase in the thermophilic and mesonitrophilic plant species and an increment in the frequencies of hemicryptophytes. This re-visitation study in the Apennines agrees with observations in other alpine ecosystems, providing new insights for a better understanding of the effects of global change on Mediterranean high-mountain biodiversity. The observed changes in floristic composition, the thermophilization process and the shift towards a more nutrient-demanding vegetation are likely attributable to the combined effect of higher temperatures and the increase in soil nutrients triggered by global change. The re-visitation approach adopted herein represents a powerful tool for studying climate-related changes in sensitive high-mountain habitats.},

@article{Ferrarini.2017,
 abstract = {High mountain systems are predicted to be especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change, with the climatically-constrained tree limit rapidly shifted upslope. In turn, the impact of upward treeline migration on mountain-dwelling bird species is expected to significantly reduce habitat suitability. We developed the first projection of the expected climate-driven rise of the whole treeline (19,256km) of the Italian Alps. The study area extends over 20,700km2, ranging over 550km in longitude and 320km in latitude. We then investigated how much the expected treeline rise will induce a) shrinking and shifting of the elevation range and b) loss in suitable habitat for the flagship species rock ptarmigan, an alpine bird species dwelling above the treeline and, similarly to many other alpine species, highly vulnerable to treeline rise. We also investigated the potential gain in suitable habitat for rock ptarmigan due to the climate-driven upshift in the uppermost thermal limit. At lower altitudes (1500-1600m a.s.l.), the average expected upshift in the current treeline resulted in 195, 274 and 354m over the short (2010-2039), medium (2040-2069) and long term (2070-2099) respectively. Above 2400m a.s.l., it was less than 30m even in the long term. Overall, during the three climate periods the extent of suitable habitat for rock ptarmigan above the current treeline is projected to decrease by 28.12{\%}, 38.43{\%} and 49.11{\%} respectively. In contrast, the expected gain in suitable habitat due to the shift in the uppermost thermal limit will be severely restrained by the limited surface extension in the top portion of the Italian Alps. The presented approach can promote similar studies elsewhere in the globe, providing a regional perspective to the projection of climate change impact on bird species dwelling above the treeline.},

We describe the general migratory patterns and found that the migratory connectivity of European roller populations is moderate and that it is stronger in eastern compared to western populations. Additionally the importance of several sites of residency like for instance the Northern Savanna zone as a stop-over region for rollers were confirmed.

This article is a very nice example of a very careful and accurate analysis, interpretation and visualization of geolocator data. Additionally it demonstrates how pooling of data and consistent re-analysis can give us a broader overview.},

@article{Frick.2010,
 abstract = {1. Estimating variation in demographic rates, such as survival and fecundity, is important for testing life-history theory and identifying conservation and management goals. 2. We used 16~years (1993--2008) of mark--recapture data to estimate age-specific survival and breeding probabilities of the little brown myotis Myotis lucifugus LeConte in southern New Hampshire, USA. Using Kendall {\&} Nichols' (1995) full-likelihood approach of the robust design to account for temporary emigration, we tested whether survival and breeding propensity is influenced by regional weather patterns and timing of reproduction. 3. Our results demonstrate that adult female survival of M. lucifugus ranged from 0·63 (95{\%} CL~=~0·56, 0·68) to 0·90 (95{\%} CL~=~0·77, 0·94), and was highest in wet years with high cumulative summer precipitation. First-year survival [range: 0·23 (95{\%} CL~=~0·14, 0·35) to 0·46 (95{\%} CL~=~0·34, 0·57)] was considerably lower than adult survival and depended on pup date of birth, such that young born earlier in the summer (c. late May) had a significantly higher probability of surviving their first year than young born later in the summer (c. mid-July). Similarly, the probability of young females returning to the maternity colony to breed in the summer following their birth year was higher for individuals born earlier in the summer [range: 0·23 (95{\%} CL~=~0·08, 0·50) to 0·53 (95{\%} CL~=~0·30, 0·75)]. 4. The positive influence of early parturition on 1st-year survival and breeding propensity demonstrates significant fitness benefits to reproductive timing in this temperate insectivorous bat. 5. Climatic factors can have important consequences for population dynamics of temperate bats, which may be negatively affected by summer drying patterns associated with global climate change. 6. Understanding long-term demographic trends will be important in the face of a novel disease phenomenon (White-Nose Syndrome) that is associated with massive mortalities in hibernating bat species, including M. lucifugus, in the northeastern United States.},

 abstract = {The endangered Uluguru Bush Shrike Malaconotus alius is a large, black-headed bush shrike, strictly endemic to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It has recently been suggested that this species has been misplaced within the genus Malaconotus and might instead be related to Malagasy Vangidae. To assess its systematic affinities, we analysed 1518 bp of sequence data obtained from a nuclear intron (myoglobin intron-2) and a mitochondrial protein-coding gene (ND2) using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Both genes strongly support the traditional placement within the genus Malaconotus, suggesting that similarities between the Uluguru Bush Shrike and the Vangidae are due to convergence. These results caution that taxonomic changes should not be made without a proper character analysis (i.e. assignment of character homology).},

@article{Fuglei.2006,
 abstract = {The Svalbard rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta hyperborea is the only resident terrestrial, herbivorous bird in Svalbard. The ptarmigan is also by far the most important small game species for hunting in Svalbard. Research performed to date on the Svalbard rock ptarmigan has mainly been physiological studies focusing on adaptations to arctic conditions. Current ecological knowledge is limitedandavailable information focuses mainly on breeding biology including behavioural aspects of breeding and social ecology. The Svalbard rock ptarmigan demonstrate different morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations. They are heavier and show substantial annual variation in body weight compared to the rock and willow ptarmigan in mainland Norway. In September-October the Svalbard rock ptarmigan increase their body weight due to fat accumulation and body fat may exceed 30 {\%} of body weight in November-December. The fat deposits make them independent of a continuous access to food when feeding is restricted during winter, and contributes to the thermal insulation. It is still not answered whether ptarmigans puts on fat and double their body weight while at the same time reduces their food intake in autumn, or whether they increase both body weight and food intake, but reduce the activity level in autumn. In April they are almost fat free even with the doubling of food intake from February until March. During summer they stay lean despite a high and stable food intake. The seasonal variation in body weight cannot be explained by variation in food intake and locomotor activity alone, though seasonal variation in daily energy expenditure must be taken into consideration. Svalbard rock ptarmigans are able to reduce their energy consumption by 16 {\%} from summer to winter. In addition they seek shelter in snow burrows to escape low temperatures and strong winds. Svalbard rock ptarmigans use separate habitats during the winter and breeding season. The wintering areas and the extent of true long-range migration of the Svalbard rock ptarmigan are not known. Flocks of migrating ptarmigans return to the breeding grounds in mid March, cocks arrive first followed by hens in early April. Altitude, terrain ruggedness and vegetation characteristics are the most significant landscape attributes that determine the presence of cocks. During breeding the cocks defend a territory varying between 3.5 and 50 hectare, which is significantly larger than found for rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta in Alaska and willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in Norway. The egg laying (9-11 eggs) starts in early to mid June, coinciding with the ambient temperature above freezing and conditions suitable for nesting and survival of offspring. The date for onset of incubation varies between years, hens of different age, body weight and quality of nesting grounds areas. The physical condition of the hens prior to the breeding season seems to be an important factor determining the chick production. The chicks hatch in late June to early July when the plants are most nutritious. The hen and her brood leave the nest 1-2 days after hatching. Only 1-2 {\%} of the young establish in the vicinity of the site where they hatched, indicating a high dispersal rate among young birds. Knowledge of population dynamics in Svalbard rock ptarmigan is limited due to lack of long-term time series data. Currently there is very little information about the population size and variance in abundance of the Svalbard rock ptarmigan. Moreover, factors that could drive ptarmigan population cycles are not studied in Svalbard. Both climate and predators are suggested as important factors determining chick production, but fluctuation in numbers may be caused by a combination of many aspects also including parasites, social factors and hunting. The Svalbard rock ptarmigan is listed as an indicator species for monitoring of terrestrial biodiversity in Svalbard (MOSI). Since 1997 hunters have reported data on numbers of ptarmigan shot, date and location for hunting and delivered one wing for age determination to the Governor of Svalbard. Since 2000 the Norwegian Polar Institute has carried out yearly spring monitoring of territorial cocks in Adventdalen with adjacent valleys and Sassendalen. The monitoring data will be analysed in order to elucidate the relationship between population size, environmental variations and harvesting of Svalbard rock ptarmigan. This information is important for sustainable management of the species.},

@article{Gerell.1985,
 abstract = {The social organization of the pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) was studied by means of bat boxes in southern Sweden. The males set up territories around a roosting site in the beginning of the summer at the same time as the females formed nursing colonies. After breeding, the females joined the single males in their day roosts establishing transient mating harems. Subsequently, immatures arrived at the mating grounds. The immature females, which probably attained sexual maturity during their first autumn, were admitted to the day roosts of the harem males, in contrast to the immature males. The size of the harem was dependent on the total number of females present on the mating grounds. The size, however, was also restricted by some factor, presumably the quantity of food resources in the surroundings of the specific roost site, or the capability of the harem male for mating. The mating system in the pipistrelle bat is best characterized as a resource defence polygyny. Available data on other related temperate species indicate a similar social organization in Pipistrellus nathusii and Nyctalus noctula.},

@article{Gienapp.2008,
 abstract = {Rapid climate change is likely to impose strong selection pressures on traits important for fitness, and therefore, microevolution in response to climate-mediated selection is potentially an important mechanism mitigating negative consequences of climate change. We reviewed the empirical evidence for recent microevolutionary responses to climate change in longitudinal studies emphasizing the following three perspectives emerging from the published data. First, although signatures of climate change are clearly visible in many ecological processes, similar examples of microevolutionary responses in literature are in fact very rare. Second, the quality of evidence for microevolutionary responses to climate change is far from satisfactory as the documented responses are often - if not typically - based on nongenetic data. We reinforce the view that it is as important to make the distinction between genetic (evolutionary) and phenotypic (includes a nongenetic, plastic component) responses clear, as it is to understand the relative roles of plasticity and genetics in adaptation to climate change. Third, in order to illustrate the difficulties and their potential ubiquity in detection of microevolution in response to natural selection, we reviewed the quantitative genetic studies on microevolutionary responses to natural selection in the context of long-term studies of vertebrates. The available evidence points to the overall conclusion that many responses perceived as adaptations to changing environmental conditions could be environmentally induced plastic responses rather than microevolutionary adaptations. Hence, clear-cut evidence indicating a significant role for evolutionary adaptation to ongoing climate warming is conspicuously scarce.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in spring arrival dates have been reported in many migratory species but the mechanism driving these advances is unknown. As population declines are most widely reported in species that are not advancing migration, there is an urgent need to identify the mechanisms facilitating and constraining these advances. Individual plasticity in timing of migration in response to changing climatic conditions is commonly proposed to drive these advances but plasticity in individual migratory timings is rarely observed. For a shorebird population that has significantly advanced migration in recent decades, we show that individual arrival dates are highly consistent between years, but that the arrival dates of new recruits to the population are significantly earlier now than in previous years. Several mechanisms could drive advances in recruit arrival, none of which require individual plasticity or rapid evolution of migration timings. In particular, advances in nest-laying dates could result in advanced recruit arrival, if benefits of early hatching facilitate early subsequent spring migration. This mechanism could also explain why arrival dates of short-distance migrants, which generally return to breeding sites earlier and have greater scope for advance laying, are advancing more rapidly than long-distance migrants.},

@article{Graf.2014b,
 abstract = {Die Intensivierung der Gr{\"u}nlandnutzung hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten auch die Schweizer Alpen erreicht. Diese Entwicklung ist besorgniserregend, denn sie betrifft die letzten R{\"u}ckzugsgebieten zahlreicher Organimsen, die auf eine grossfl{\"a}chig extensive Wieslandnutzung angewiesen sind. Wie stark der Intensivierungsschub bereits auf die Vegetation gewirkt hat, wurde erstmals in einer weitr{\"a}umigen Studie gemessen. Wir haben auf 58 {\"u}ber das ganze Engadin verteilten Untersuchungsfl{\"a}chen  (zusammen 12,53 km2) die Entwicklung der Vegetation und der Nutzungsintensit{\"a}t zwischen 1987/88 und 2009/10 sowie den Einfluss diverser  Standortsbedingungen untersucht.Die unged{\"u}ngten Vegetationstypen haben in diesem Zeitraum 20{\%} ihrer urspr{\"u}nglichen Fl{\"a}che verloren. Am gr{\"o}ssten waren die Verluste in Gemeinden, in welchen vor kurzem landwirtschaftliche Meliorationsprojekte realisiert worden waren. Zugenommen haben daf{\"u}r  die intensiv genutzten Wiesen und Weiden. Interessanterweise stammt der Zuwachs nicht in erster Linie von weniger intensiv genutzten Fettwiesen (Goldhaferwiesen, Trisetion) sondern von gem{\"a}hten, ehemaligen Halbtrockenrasen. Die wenig intensiv genutzten, m{\"a}ssig ged{\"u}ngten Fettwiesen haben n{\"a}mlich ebenfalls zugenommen, was wohl durch den Abschluss zahlreicher naturschutzfachlich motivierter Bewirtschaftungsvertr{\"a}ge zwischen Beh{\"o}rden und Bewirtschaftern zu erkl{\"a}ren ist. Der Staat unterst{\"u}tzt also einerseits die Intensivierung durch die Subventionierung von Meliorationsprojekten, anderseits auch die Extensivierung durch den Abschluss von Vertr{\"a}gen. Hingegen ist Vergandung im Engadin bisher kein grossr{\"a}umiges Problem. Vermutlich wird sie durch die Naturschutzvertr{\"a}ge erfolgreich gemindert. Einzig die ertragsschw{\"a}chsten Vegetationseinheiten sind von Nutzungsaufgabe betroffen. So wurden 19{\%} der in den 1980er-Jahren extensiv beweideten Trockenrasen (Xerobromion) 2009/10 als verbrachend kartiert. Trotz der erw{\"a}hnten, bedauerlichen Verluste bleibt das Engadin einer der wichtigsten Biodiversit{\"a}ts-Hotspots der Schweizer Alpen. Die immer noch sehr vielf{\"a}ltige Landschaft mit den einmaligen bl{\"u}henden Wiesenlandschaften zieht im Unterengadin mittlerweile mehr Sommer- als Wintertouristen an. Damit diese Werte erhalten bleiben, ist es notwendig, dass m{\"o}gliche negative Auswirkungen von landwirtschaftlichen Infrastrukturprojekten zuk{\"u}nftig einer noch eingehenderen Pr{\"u}fung unterzogen werden.},

 abstract = {The global pledge to deliver 'a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010' is echoed in a number of regional and national level targets. There is broad consensus, however, that in the absence of conservation action, biodiversity will continue to be lost at a rate unprecedented in the recent era. Remarkably, we lack a basic system to measure progress towards these targets and, in particular, we lack standard measures of biodiversity and procedures to construct and assess summary statistics. Here, we develop a simple classification of biodiversity indicators to assist their development and clarify purpose. We use European birds, as example taxa, to show how robust indicators can be constructed and how they can be interpreted. We have developed statistical methods to calculate supranational, multi-species indices using population data from national annual breeding bird surveys in Europe. Skilled volunteers using standardized field methods undertake data collection where methods and survey designs differ slightly across countries. Survey plots tend to be widely distributed at a national level, covering many bird species and habitats with reasonable representation. National species' indices are calculated using log-linear regression, which allows for plot turnover. Supranational species' indices are constructed by combining the national species' indices weighted by national population sizes of each species. Supranational, multi-species indicators are calculated by averaging the resulting indices. We show that common farmland birds in Europe have declined steeply over the last two decades, whereas woodland birds have not. Evidence elsewhere shows that the main driver of farmland bird declines is increased agricultural intensification. We argue that the farmland bird indicator is a useful surrogate for trends in other elements of biodiversity in this habitat.},

@article{Greiner.2014,
 abstract = {Bats live substantially longer than any other similar-sized mammal despite high metabolic rates during flight. The underlying causes for the longevity of bats and the question whether bats exhibit signs of senescence -- a progressive deterioration in performance -- are still unclear. Here, we describe rates of senescence in individual annual fitness, survival and reproduction using survival and recruitment data collected over an 18-yr period from 77 males and 81 females in a wild population of Saccopteryx bilineata (greater sac-winged bat), a polygynous species inhabiting colonies where female groups are defended each by a territorial male. In individuals older than 4~yr of age, individual fitness contribution, survival and recruitment declined with increasing age in males but not in females. Rates of senescence in annual individual fitness and in reproduction of males were at least an order of magnitude higher than those of females. This finding might be explained by the `disposable soma theory' that attributes senescence to an optimal allocation of resources to somatic maintenance and competing traits such as reproduction. The rate of senescence in the survival of males was also significant but of the same order of magnitude as the (non-significant) rate of females. Unlike many other polygynous mammals, greater sac-winged bats show little overt male--male competition. As senescence in survival was only weak in males, our results are consistent with the theories for polygynous mammals, which view the trade-off between male investment in physical traits for intense male--male competition against survival as a major source of the decline of male survival with age. This is the first study to demonstrate sex-specific senescence rates in a wild population of a small, long-lived mammalian species.},

 abstract = {Resource pulses such as mast seeding in temperate forests may affect interspecific interactions over multiple trophic levels and link different seed and nonseed consumers directly via predation or indirectly via shared predators. However, the nature and strength of interactions among species remain unknown for most resource pulse-driven ecosystems. We considered five hypotheses concerning the influence of resource pulses on the interactions between rodents, predators, and bird reproduction with data from northern Switzerland collected between 2010 and 2015. In high-rodent-abundance-years (HRAYs), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) nest survival was lower than in low-rodent-abundance-years, but rodents were not important nest predators, in contrast to rodent-hunting predators. The higher proportion of nests predated by rodent-hunting predators and their increased occurrence in HRAYs suggests a rodent-mediated aggregative numerical response of rodent-hunting predators, which incidentally prey on the wood warbler's ground nests. There was no evidence that rodent-hunting predators responded behaviorally by switching prey. Lastly, nest losses caused by nonrodent-hunting predators were not related to rodent abundance. We show that wood warblers and rodents are linked via shared predators in a manner consistent with apparent competition, where an increase of one species coincides with the decrease of another species mediated by shared predators. Mast seeding frequency and annual seed production appear to have increased over the past century, which may result in more frequent HRAYs and generally higher peaking rodent populations. The associated increase in the magnitude of apparent competition may thus at least to some extent explain the wood warbler's decline in much of Western Europe.},

@article{Gudmundsson.1994,
 abstract = {The bird migration pattern in June in southern Scandinavia was analysed on the basis of registrations from six years 1986-1991 by a long-range surveillance radar located in Scania, southern Sweden. The timing of migration, field observations and identification of some echoes suggested that mainly Knots Calidris c. canutus, on their way between the Wadden Sea and breeding grounds along the high arctic coasts of Siberia, were involved in the movements analysed. The daily timing was similar each year, with a peak passage across Scania in the night. The median time of passage (all years combined) was three hours after local sunset. The Knots have probably flown directly from well-known staging sites in the German Wadden Sea, and the median departure time from there was estimated to occur 1 1/2 h before sunset. The average track direction was 63 degree +- 14 degree angular deviation. This is slightly, but significantly, to the south of the constant compass bearing (rhumbline = 57 degree ) between the German Wadden Sea and possible destination areas on the north coast of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia. Track directions varied significantly with wind, suggesting partial drift or pseudodrift. The groundspeed (25.6 m s-1) was on average 6.1 or 7.6 m s-1 (depending on the assumed flight altitude) faster than the estimated airspeed, showing that the majority of flocks had considerable tailwind assistance. Significantly more echoes were recorded in tailwinds than in winds from other directions relative to the average track direction. Evaluation of course changes of echoes tracked while crossing five degrees of longitude, over distances up to 400 km, showed that the birds did not follow any of the predicted paths according to known orientation mechanisms (sun-, star-, magnetic compasses). Rather, the overall migration route may be influenced by topography in a way that maximizes association with coastal areas.},

 abstract = {Identifying the factors shaping variation in parasite diversity among host species is crucial to understand wildlife diseases. Although micro- and macroparasites may exert different selective pressures on their hosts, studies investigating the determinants of parasite species richness in animals have rarely considered this divide. Here, we investigated the role of host life history and ecology in explaining the species richness of helminths (macroparasites) and haemosporidians (microparasites) in birds world-wide. We collated data from multiple global datasets on diverse bird traits (longevity, body mass, coloniality, migration distance/tendency, geographic range size and dietary and habitat breadths) and the species richness of their helminth and haemosporidian parasites. We tested predictors of helminth and haemosporidian parasite richness using phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework. We found that, after controlling for research effort and host phylogeny, the richness of helminths, but not of haemosporidians, increased with host longevity, range size, migration distance and dietary breadth. Overall, these correlates were also important across different helminth groups (acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes and trematodes), and two additional ones (body mass, coloniality) emerged as important for cestodes and acanthocephalans. We propose that long life spans may promote the diversity of helminth parasite assemblages over evolutionary time, thus resulting in richer helminth faunas. Similarly, longer-distance migrations, larger ranges and broader dietary breadths are likely to lead to greater encounter rates and the accumulation of trophically transmitted helminths. In contrast, vector-borne haemosporidians may be influenced more by factors related to vector ecology than by the host traits included in the analyses. The lack of strong associations between haemosporidian species richness and host characteristics emphasizes the need to find appropriate traits to model the distribution and diversity of parasites with different environmental preferences in order to anticipate disease emergence risks associated with global change.},

@article{Guyot.2017,
 abstract = {Vineyards are likely to be regionally important for wildlife, but we lack biodiversity studies in this agroecosystem which is undergoing a rapid management revolution. As vine cultivation is restricted to arid and warm climatic regions, biodiversity-friendly management would promote species typical of southern biomes. Vineyards are often intensively cultivated, mostly surrounded by few natural features and offering a fairly mineral appearance with little ground vegetation cover. Ground vegetation cover and composition may further strongly vary with respect to season, influencing patterns of habitat selection by ecological communities. We investigated season-specific bird-habitat associations to highlight the importance of semi-natural habitat features and vineyard ground vegetation cover throughout the year. Given that avian habitat selection varies according to taxa, guilds and spatial scale, we modelled bird-habitat associations in all months at two spatial scales using mixed effects regression models. At the landscape scale, birds were recorded along 10 1-km long transects in Southwestern Switzerland (February 2014 -January 2015). At the field scale, we compared the characteristics of visited and unvisited vineyard fields (hereafter called parcels). Bird abundance in vineyards tripled in winter compared to summer. Vineyards surrounded by a greater amount of hedges and small woods harboured higher bird abundance, species richness and diversity, especially during the winter season. Regarding ground vegetation, birds showed a season-specific habitat selection pattern, notably a marked preference for ground-vegetated parcels in winter and for intermediate vegetation cover in spring and summer. These season-specific preferences might be related to species-specific life histories: more insectivorous, ground-foraging species occur during the breeding season whereas granivores predominate in winter. These results highlight the importance of investigating habitat selection at different spatial scales and all along the annual cycle in order to draw practical, season-specific management recommendations for promoting avian biodiversity in farmland.},

@article{Hahn.2018,
 abstract = {Blood parasites (Haemosporidia) are thought to impair the flight performance of infected animals, and therefore, infected birds are expected to differ from their non-infected counterparts in migratory capacity. Since haemosporidians invade host erythrocytes, it is commonly assumed that infected individuals will have compromised aerobic capacity, but this has not been examined in free-living birds. We tested if haemosporidian infections affect aerobic performance by examining metabolic rates and exercise endurance in migratory great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) experimentally treated withPlasmodium relictumpGRW04 and in naturally infected wild birds over consecutive life-history stages. We found no effect of acute or chronic infections on resting metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate or exercise endurance in either experimentally treated or free-living birds. Oxygen consumption rates during rest and while undergoing maximum exercise as well as exercise endurance increased from breeding to migration stages in both infected and non-infected birds. Importantly, phenotypic changes associated with preparation for migration were similarly unaffected by parasitaemia. Consequently, migratory birds experiencing parasitaemia levels typical of chronic infection do not differ in migratory capacity from their uninfected counterparts. Thus, if infected hosts differ from uninfected conspecifics in migration phenology, other mechanisms besides aerobic capacity should be considered.},

 abstract = {Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76{\%}, and mid-summer decline of 82{\%} in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

@article{Harbusch.2006,
 abstract = {ABSTRACT Maternity colonies of serotine bats inhabiting large roof spaces were studied at three localities in southwestern Germany and Luxembourg. Bats of all three colonies returned to the maternity roosts during the second or third week of April, and were strongly philopatric to their main roost. Roost switching occurred only rarely and for short periods. Measurements of temperature inside two roosts showed gradients according to height and aspect of the roof space with a mean roost temperature of 22°C during gestation and lactation. The availability of adequate microclimates within the roost during gestation and lactation was thought to favour roost philopatry. Females of all ages and reproductive classes inhabit the roosts throughout summer. Mean ($\pm$ SD) inferred gestation length was 52 $\pm$ 6 days, and variations were not related to roost temperatures during gestation. The mean date of birth was 16th June with most births occurring within a period of 14 $\pm$ 6 days and of young first emerged from the roost 36 $\pm$ 7 days after birth. Prolonged adverse weather conditions, leading to low roost temperatures, resulted in mortality of 11--27{\%} of preweaning young in four of the five years studied. Since immigration occurs, the number of young emerging from the roost cannot be deduced from the number of females present during gestation or lactation. Adult females and young start to disperse after the first young are weaned at the beginning of August and are last observed in October. The implications of these results for the epidemiology of European bat lyssavirus 1 are discussed.},

 abstract = {According to theory, edge populations may be poised to expand species' ranges if they are locally adapted to extreme conditions, or ill-suited to colonise beyond-range habitat if their offspring are genetically and competitively inferior. We tested these contrasting predictions by transplanting low-, mid-, and high-elevation (edge) populations of an annual plant throughout and above its elevational distribution. Seed from poor-quality edge habitat (one of two transects) had inferior emergence, but edge seeds also had adaptive phenology (both transects). High-elevation plants flowered earlier, required less heat accumulation to mature seed, and so achieved higher lifetime fitness at and above the range edge. Experimental warming improved fitness above the range, but eliminated the advantage of local cold-edge populations, supporting recent models in which cold-adapted edge populations do not facilitate warming-induced range shifts. The highest above-range fitness was achieved by a 'super edge phenotype' from a neighbouring mountain, suggesting key adaptations exist regionally even if absent from local edge populations.},

@article{Healy.2014,
 abstract = {Maximum lifespan in birds and mammals varies strongly with body mass such that large species tend to live longer than smaller species. However, many species live far longer than expected given their body mass. This may reflect interspecific variation in extrinsic mortality, as life-history theory predicts investment in long-term survival is under positive selection when extrinsic mortality is reduced. Here, we investigate how multiple ecological and mode-of-life traits that should reduce extrinsic mortality (including volancy (flight capability), activity period, foraging environment and fossoriality), simultaneously influence lifespan across endotherms. Using novel phylogenetic comparative analyses and to our knowledge, the most species analysed to date (n = 1368), we show that, over and above the effect of body mass, the most important factor enabling longer lifespan is the ability to fly. Within volant species, lifespan depended upon when (day, night, dusk or dawn), but not where (in the air, in trees or on the ground), species are active. However, the opposite was true for non-volant species, where lifespan correlated positively with both arboreality and fossoriality. Our results highlight that when studying the molecular basis behind cellular processes such as those underlying lifespan, it is important to consider the ecological selection pressures that shaped them over evolutionary time.},

@article{Hector.2012,
 abstract = {Heinz Ellenberg's historically important work on changes in the abundances of a community of grass species growing along

experimental gradients of water table depth has played an important role in helping to identify the hydrological niches of

plant species in wet meadows. We present a previously unpublished complete version of Ellenberg's dataset from the 1950s

together with the results of a series of modern statistical analyses testing for hypothesized overyielding of aboveground net

primary production as a consequence of resource-based niche differentiation. Interactions of species with water table depth

and soil type in the results of our analyses are qualitatively consistent with earlier interpretations of evidence for differences

in the fundamental and realized niches of species. Arrhenatherum elatius tended to dominate communities and this effect

was generally positively related to increasing water table depth. There was little overyielding of aboveground net primary

production during the two repeats of the experiment conducted in successive single growing seasons. Examination of how

the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes vary across environmental gradients is an underutilized approach --

particularly where the gradient is thought to be an axis of niche differentiation as is the case with water availability.

Furthermore, advances in ecology and statistics during the 60 years since Ellenberg's classic experiment was performed

suggest that it may be worth repeating over a longer duration and with modern experimental design and methodologies},

@article{Helm.2006,
 abstract = {Timing is essential in seasonally changing habitats. Survival and reproduction are enhanced through

precise adjustment to environmental conditions. Avian seasonal behaviour, that is, diverse activities

associated with reproduction, moult and migration, has an endogenous basis and is ultimately linked to

changes in environmental factors such as food supply. However, behaviour occurs in social contexts,

and interactions with conspecifics are intimately linked to seasonal activities. Time programmes set the

stage for social behaviour, which in turn fine-tunes seasonal activities. We propose that avian schedules

are genuinely ﾑsociableﾒ: birds communicate seasonal behaviour by both intentional and inadvertent information

transfer and negotiate it in competitive and cooperative interactions. Studying the interplay between

seasonal and social behaviour can add to our understanding of animal behaviour, including

mechanisms by which birds could cope with changing environmental conditions.},

@article{Heppell.2000b,
 abstract = {Elasticity analysis is a useful tool in conservation biology. The relative impacts of proportional changes in fertility, juvenile survival, and adult survival on asymptotic population growth \textgreek{l} (where ln(\textgreek{l}) = r, the intrinsic rate of increase) are determined by vital rates (survival, growth, and fertility), which also define the life history characteristics of a species or population. Because we do not have good demographic information for most threatened populations, it is useful to categorize species according to their life history characteristics and related elasticity patterns. To do this, we compared the elasticity patterns generated by the life tables of 50 mammal populations. In age-classified models, the sum of the fertility elasticities and the survival elasticity for each juvenile age-class are equal; thus, age at maturity has a large impact on the contribution of juvenile survival to \textgreek{l}. Mammals that mature early and have large litters (``fast'' mammals, such as rodents and smaller carnivores) also generally have short lifespans; these populations had relatively high fertility elasticities and lower adult survival elasticities. ``Slow'' mammals (those that mature late), having few offspring and higher adult survival rates (such as ungulates and marine mammals), had much lower fertility elasticities and high adult or juvenile survival elasticities. Although certain life history characteristics are phylogenetically constrained, we found that elasticity patterns within an order or family can be quite diverse, while similar elasticity patterns can occur in distantly related taxa. We extended our generalizations by developing a simple age-classified model parameterized by juvenile survival, mean adult survival, age at maturity, and mean annual fertility. The elasticity patterns of this model are determined by age at maturity, mean adult survival, and \textgreek{l}, and they compare favorably with the summed elasticities of full Leslie matrices. Thus, elasticity patterns can be predicted, even when complete life table information is unavailable. In addition to classifying species for management purposes, the results generated by this simplified model show how elasticity patterns may change if the vital rate information is uncertain. Elasticity analysis can be a qualitative guide for research and management, particularly for poorly known species, and a useful first step in a larger modeling effort to determine population viability.},

 abstract = {In the Okanagan valley of British Columbia, Myotis lucifugus and Myotis yumanensis are sympatric and some individuals are intermediate in typical morphology. A survey of electrophoretic variation at 31 protein loci of intermediate bats indicates no evidence of hybridization. Discriminant analysis on these specimens shows better separation by skull characters than by external measurements, but 13 bats (14{\%} of 93 examined) were designated as intermediate and 7 could have been labelled hybrids. Absence of electrophoretic evidence of hybridization indicates that similar morphology reflects overlap in extremes of intraspecific morphological variation. Myotis lucifugus was trapped in the western foothills adjacent to the Okanagan River and foraged in all of the habitats we sampled. Myotis yumanensis was only trapped in the valley and preferred to forage over flowing water. There was no evidence of agonistic interactions between the two species.

@article{Hille.2015b,
 abstract = {Life-history traits in birds, such as lifespan, age at maturity, and rate of reproduction, vary across environments and in combinations imposed by trade-offs and limitations of physiological mechanisms. A plethora of studies have described the diversity of traits and hypothesized selection pressures shaping components of the survival-reproduction trade-off. Life-history variation appears to fall along a slow-fast continuum, with slow pace characterized by higher investment in survival over reproduction and fast pace characterized by higher investment in reproduction over survival. The Pace-of-Life Syndrome (POLS) is a framework to describe the slow-fast axis of variation in life-history traits and physiological traits. The POLS corresponds to latitudinal gradients, with tropical birds exhibiting a slow pace of life. We examined four possible ways that the traits of high-elevation birds might correspond to the POLS continuum: (i) rapid pace, (ii) tropical slow pace, (iii) novel elevational pace, or (iv) constrained pace. Recent studies reveal that birds breeding at high elevations in temperate zones exhibit a combination of traits creating a unique elevational pace of life with a central trade-off similar to a slow pace but physiological trade-offs more similar to a fast pace. A paucity of studies prevents consideration of the possibility of a constrained pace of life. We propose extending the POLS framework to include trait variation of elevational clines to help to investigate complexity in global geographic patterns.},

 abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurological disorder that is caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion and for which there is no effective therapy. Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional dysregulation may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. Supporting this view, administration of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has been shown to rescue lethality and photoreceptor neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of polyglutamine disease. To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors, we have conducted preclinical trials with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a potent HDAC inhibitor, in the R6/2 HD mouse model. We show that SAHA crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases histone acetylation in the brain. We found that SAHA could be administered orally in drinking water when complexed with cyclodextrins. SAHA dramatically improved the motor impairment in R6/2 mice, clearly validating the pursuit of this class of compounds as HD therapeutics.},

Here we use a combination of field experimentation, genetic analysis and demographic data to show that a reduction in winter food supply caused by agricultural intensification is probably the principal explanation for the widespread local extinctions of rural house-sparrow populations in southern England. We show that farmland populations exhibit fine-level genetic structuring and that some populations are unable to sustain themselves (sinks), whereas others act as sources.},

@article{Holland.2009b,
 abstract = {The identification of the sensory cues and mechanisms by which migratory birds are able to reach the same breeding and wintering grounds year after year has eluded biologists despite more than 50 years of intensive study. While a number of environmental cues have been proposed to play a role in the navigation of birds, arguments still persist about which cues are essential for the experience based navigation shown by adult migrants. To date, few studies have tested the sensory basis of navigational cues used during actual migration in the wild: mainly laboratory based studies or homing during the non-migratory season have been used to investigate this behaviour. Here we tested the role of olfactory and magnetic cues in the migration of the catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) by radio tracking the migration of birds with sensory manipulations during their actual migratory flights. Our data suggest that adult birds treated with zinc sulphate to produce anosmia were unable to show the same orientation as control adults, and instead reverted to a direction similar to that shown by juveniles making their first migration. The magnetic manipulation had no effect on the orientation of either adults or juveniles. These results allow us to propose that the olfactory sense may play a role in experience based migration in adult catbirds. While the olfactory sense has been shown to play a role in the homing of pigeons and other birds, this is the first time it has been implicated in migratory orientation.},

In wildlife ecological studies, satellite-based data and methodology have provided a wealth of information about animal space use and the investigation of individual-based animal-environment relationships. With the technology for data collection improving dramatically over time, we are left with massive archives of historical animal telemetry data of varying quality. While many contemporary statistical approaches for inferring movement behavior are specified in discrete time, we develop a flexible continuous-time stochastic integral equation framework that is amenable to reduced-rank second-order covariance parameterizations. We demonstrate how the associated first-order basis functions can be constructed to mimic behavioral characteristics in realistic trajectory processes using telemetry data from mule deer and mountain lion individuals in western North America. Our approach is parallelizable and provides inference for heterogeneous trajectories using nonstationary spatial modeling techniques that are feasible for large telemetry data sets.},

@article{Hoying.1998,
 abstract = {We describe the size and developmental state at birth, examine factors which influence intra- and inter-year variation in post-natal growth, and derive age-predictive equations and logistic growth parameters for the eastern pipistrelle bat, Pipistrellus subflavus. Ambient and roost temperature and insect abundance were lowest, and precipitation highest, before and during the post-natal growth period in 1982, as compared to 1981. We found no sex differences in the size of pups at birth or in post-natal growth rates in a given year; however, body mass and length of forearm of neonates differed significantly between years, being smaller in 1982 than in 1981. During the first two weeks of post-natal growth in both years, the body mass and length of forearm of pups increased linearly at mean rates of 0.15 g.day$-$1 and 1.12 mm.day$-$1, respectively. Post-natal growth rates for length of forearm and body mass were the same during the early linear phase of growth, but the intercept for body mass was less and growth trajectories were more variable in 1982. Length of forearm was the least variable and thus most reliable character for estimating age of P. subflavus pups during the first 14 days of post-natal growth. When length of forearm was used in combination with mean changes in the length of the fourth metacarpal-phalangeal epiphyseal gap, we derived reliable age-estimation equations ranging from 1 to 45 days. Litter size averaged 1.96 and 1.93 at birth, but this was reduced to one by the time pups became volant. At birth, litter mass represented 44, and 54{\%} of the post-partum mass of females in 1981 and 1982, respectively. This maternal effort during pregnancy is among the highest reported for bats. At weaning, the body mass of pups approached 80{\%} of adult post-partum body mass, and the length of forearm exceeded 90{\%} of adult female size. Our results suggest that size at birth and post-natal growth are influenced by ambient and roost temperature, rainfall, and the quantity of insects available to pregnant and lactating females. Thus, energetic constraints on both mothers and pups can lead to inter-year and inter-individual differences in maternal effort and post-natal growth of pups.},

 abstract = {A sub-colony of 20 pipistrelle bats was studied during late pregnancy and lactation. Seventeen females gave birth to single young, with 16 young surviving to weaning. Free association and flight were permitted, and mother-infant pairs were identified and marked on the day of birth (day 0). Suckling associations were identified daily (n = 195) and females were never found suckling young other than their own. A series of choice experiments using young aged 0--10 days and 15--25 days indicated that females would permit only their own offspring to suckle during both early and late lactation. During early lactation, mothers actively selected their young and encouraged suckling but did not do so during late lactation. Mothers were most often indifferent to approaches by alien young but occasionally aggressively rejected them. Mothers never aggressively rejected their own young but frequently were indifferent to them. Young attempted to suckle from any mother without discrimination.},

 abstract = {A growing number of studies have documented shifts in avian migratory phenology in response to climate change, and yet there is a large amount of unexplained variation in the magnitude of those responses across species and geographic regions. We use a database of citizen science bird observations to explore spatiotemporal variation in mean arrival dates across an unprecedented geographic extent for 18 common species in North America over the past decade, relating arrival dates to mean minimum spring temperature. Across all species and geographic locations, species shifted arrival dates 0.8 days earlier for every °C of warming of spring temperature, but it was common for some species in some locations to shift as much as 3-6 days earlier per °C. Species that advanced arrival dates the earliest in response to warming were those that migrate more slowly, short distance migrants, and species with broader climatic niches. These three variables explained 63{\%} of the interspecific variation in phenological response. We also identify a latitudinal gradient in the average strength of phenological response, with species shifting arrival earlier at southern latitudes than northern latitudes for the same degree of warming. This observation is consistent with the idea that species must be more phenologically sensitive in less seasonal environments to maintain the same degree of precision in phenological timing.},

 abstract = {Widespread reports of bat fatalities caused by wind turbines have raised concerns about the impacts of wind power development. Reliable estimates of the total number killed and the potential effects on populations are needed, but it is crucial that they be based on sound data. In a recent BioScience article, Hayes (2013) estimated that over 600,000 bats were killed at wind turbines in the United States in 2012. The scientific errors in the analysis are numerous, with the two most serious being that the included sites constituted a convenience sample, not a representative sample, and that the individual site estimates are derived from such different methodologies that they are inherently not comparable. This estimate is almost certainly inaccurate, but whether the actual number is much smaller, much larger, or about the same is uncertain. An accurate estimate of total bat fatality is not currently possible, given the shortcomings of the available data.},

@article{huso2015EoA,
 abstract = {Many wind-power facilities in the United States have established effective monitoring programs to determine turbine-caused fatality rates of birds and bats. But estimating the number of fatalities of rare species poses special difficulties. The loss of even small numbers of individuals may adversely affect fragile populations, but typically, few (if any) carcasses are observed during monitoring. If monitoring design results in only a small proportion of carcasses detected, then finding zero carcasses may give little assurance that the number of actual fatalities was small. Fatality monitoring at wind-power facilities commonly involves conducting experiments to estimate the probability (g) an individual will be observed, accounting for the possibilities that it falls in an unsearched area, is scavenged prior to detection, or remains undetected even when present. When g{\textless}1, the total carcass count (X) underestimates the total number of fatalities (M). Total counts can be 0 when M is small or when M is large and g?1. Distinguishing these two cases is critical when estimating fatality of a rare species. Observing no individuals during searches may erroneously be interpreted as evidence of absence. We present an approach that uses Bayes' theorem to construct a posterior distribution for M, i.e., P(M|X,g ?), reflecting the observed carcass count and previously estimated g. From this distribution we calculate two values important to conservation: the probability that M is below a pre-determined limit; and the upper bound (M{\^{}}*) of the 100(1-\textgreek{a}){\%} credible interval for M. We investigate the dependence of M{\^{}}* on \textgreek{a}, g and the prior distribution of M, asking what value of g is required to attain a desired M{\^{}}* for a given \textgreek{a}. We found that when g{\textless}{\~{}}0.15, M{\^{}}* was clearly influenced by the mean and variance of g ? and the choice of prior distribution for M, but the influence of these factors is minimal when g{\textgreater}{\~{}}0.45. Further, we develop extensions for temporal replication that can inform prior distributions of M; and methods for combining information across several areas or time periods. We apply the method to data collected at a wind-power facility where scheduled searches yielded X=0 raptor carcasses.},

 abstract = {The most popular method used to gain an understanding of population trends or of differences in bird abundance among land condition categories is to use information derived from point counts. Unfortunately, various factors can affect one's ability to detect birds, and those factors need to be controlled or accounted for so that any difference in one's index among time periods or locations is an accurate reflection of differences in bird abundance and not differences in detectability. Avian ecologists could use appropriately sized fixed-area surveys to minimize the chance that they might be deceived by distance-based detectability bias, but the current method of choice is to use a modeling approach that allows one to account for distance-based bias by modeling the effects of distance on detectability or occupancy. I challenge the idea that modeling is the best approach to account for distance-based effects on the detectability of birds because the most important distance-based modeling assumptions can never be met. The use of a fixed-area survey method to generate an index of abundance is the simplest way to control for distance-based detectability bias and should not be universally condemned or be the basis for outright rejection in the publication process.},

@article{Ibanez.2009,
 abstract = {Abstract Sexual segregation during the breeding season is common in many temperate bat species, and may be related to sex-specific thermoregulatory, microclimatic, or energetic requirements. We compiled capture data for 3 species of Nyctalus (noctule bats) obtained over {\textgreater}20 years to study reproductive and migratory strategies of these species in southwestern Europe. Within the Iberian Peninsula, several different strategies regarding sex distribution and migratory behavior were observed within each of the 3 Nyctalus species. In the northern part of Iberia there are populations of the 3 species composed of males all year-round with females appearing only during the mating season. Reproduction by females in this area has not been confirmed. In central and southern Iberia there are breeding populations in which sexual segregation occurs only at the roosts or at a regional scale, possibly with females located at lower elevations during the breeding season. Female-biased, long-distance migration is likely to be the cause of sexual segregation in populations of N. noctula and N. leisleri in northern and central Iberia, but not of N. lasiopterus, absent in central Europe. For this latter species, segregation by elevation also could occur in northern Iberia. The Iberian Peninsula is a good example of how breeding strategies and migratory behavior in bats can be very flexible and vary across relatively small geographical scales.},

We review emerging methods to estimate alpha, beta, gamma, and metacommunity diversity through hierarchical multispecies occupancy models (MSOMs) and multispecies abundance models (MSAMs) that explicitly incorporate observation error in the detection process for species or individuals. We examine advantages, limitations, and assumptions of these detection-based hierarchical models for estimating species diversity. Accounting for imperfect detection using these approaches has influenced conclusions of comparative community studies and creates new opportunities for testing theory.},

@article{Jensen.2013,
 abstract = {Population genetic structure and intrapopulation levels of genetic variation have important implications for population dynamics and evolutionary processes. Habitat fragmentation is one of the major threats to biodiversity. It leads to smaller population sizes and reduced gene flow between populations and will thus also affect genetic structure. We use a natural system of island and mainland populations of house sparrows along the coast of Norway to characterize the different population genetic properties of fragmented populations. We genotyped 636 individuals distributed across 14 populations at 15 microsatellite loci. The level of genetic differentiation was estimated using F-statistics and specially designed Mantel tests were conducted to study the influence of population type (i.e. mainland or island) and geographic distance on the genetic population structure. Furthermore, the effects of population type, population size and latitude on the level of genetic variation within populations were examined. Our results suggest that genetic processes on islands and mainland differed in two important ways. First, the intrapopulation level of genetic variation tended to be lower and the occurrence of population bottlenecks more frequent on islands than the mainland. Second, although the general level of genetic differentiation was low to moderate, it was higher between island populations than between mainland populations. However, differentiation increased in mainland populations somewhat faster with geographical distance. These results suggest that population bottleneck events and genetic drift have been more important in shaping the genetic composition of island populations compared with populations on the mainland. Such knowledge is relevant for a better understanding of evolutionary processes and conservation of threatened populations.},

 abstract = {Distribution and minimum population densities for seven UK bat species known to be resident in northern England were calculated in an area covering 2500 km2. The species present were pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), brown long-eared (Plecotus auritus), Daubenton's (Myotis daubentonii), whiskered (Myotis mystacinus), Natterer's (Myotis nattereri), noctule (Nyctalus noctula) and Brandt's (Myotis brandtii). Data were collected primarily from counts at summer roosts over the period 1983 to 1990. A total of 310 bat roosts were discovered within the study area. Of the 256 roosts at which the species present was identified, the majority, 127 (49.6{\%}) were P. pipistrellus, with a mean maternity roost size of 69.6 bats. A minimum population density of 12.6 batskm$-$2 was estimated for P. pipistrellus, based on summer (maternity) roosts. The minimum population density estimate was higher than previous studies in northern England but substantially lower than those reported in Scotland (18.2 bats km-$-$2). The combined density of M. mystacinus, M. brandtii, and P. pipistrellus, which have similar foraging styles (15.8 bats km$-$2), is comparable to Scottish P. pipistrellus densities. The density of M. duubentonii was also lower than in Scotland, although the density of P. auritus was comparable. The majority of summer roosts for all species were found in buildings, except N. noctula and M. duubentonii which used bridges/tunnels or trees.},

 abstract = {The meridional serotine bat Eptesicus isabellinus is found in North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. We analyzed the genetic structure of E. isabellinus at two different geographic scales to reveal the historical and ecological patterns that have shaped its populations. The role of the Straits of Gibraltar as an isolating barrier between African and Iberian populations is evaluated and the degree of genetic structure and female-mediated gene flow was assessed at a local scale between neighboring colonies. Populations of E. isabellinus from Iberia and northern Morocco show little genetic divergence and share mtDNA haplotypes, indicating that the Straits of Gibraltar are neither an impediment to dispersal nor a cause of genetic differentiation. Our results also suggest that E. isabellinus may have dispersed from western Andalusia into northern Morocco after the last glacial period. At a smaller geographic scale, the colonies studied showed high variation in genetic variability and structure, indicating that no female-mediated gene flow is present. This pattern is consistent with a described pattern of independent endemic viral circulation of the bat rabies virus EBLV-1, which was found when studying rabies dynamics in the same serotine bat colonies.},

The body condition of foraging females and young varied during the season (May to August). Parturition occurred about mid-June and the first flying young were captured in the first half of July. The ectoparasites were recorded in 56.5{\%} of examined bats and comprised seven arthropod species of mites, fleas and flies; the most common were the mites Spinturnix helvetiae (55.4{\%}) and Steatonyssus spinosus (31.3{\%}). Pregnant females were the most infested. Ectoparasitic flies Nycteribia latreillii and Nycteribia (Acrocholidia) vexata were recorded for the first time in this species. Seven orders of insects were found in the faecal pellets examined. By frequency (F{\%}) and volume (V{\%}), the major food items comprised Lepidoptera (F = 100.0, V = 55.7) and Diptera (F = 91.5, V = 25.6). The four most abundant prey categories by volume varied significantly seasonally.},

 abstract = {For the assessment of the habitat use of bats with consideration of a complexity of environmental features a large-scale multivariate canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed. Data were collected in April--September (1999--2005) using mist-netting and bat-detectors (n=209 samplings) in Slovakia (n=160 sites). For the habitat description, 17 environmental variables that characterised the sampling site, tree-species composition and general character of surrounding forest were selected. In study sites, altogether 93{\%} of Slovak chiropterofauna species were recorded but only 16 species (2466 individuals) were recorded in more than 5{\%} of samplings. The most common and frequent species were Myotis mystacinus (frequency of occurrence=57{\%}, species dominance=12{\%}) and Myotis myotis (44{\%}, 10{\%}), followed by Barbastella barbastellus (32{\%}, 6{\%}), Plecotus auritus (32{\%}, 6{\%}), Nyctalus noctula (31{\%}, 9{\%}) and Myotis brandtii (31{\%}, 7{\%}). Of the tested environmental variables used in CCA analysis, 13 had significant influence on the species' presence. On the base of gradients in ordination analysis, there were two main groups of species. In the first ``true'' forest bats group the tree-dwelling and gleaning species Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis nattereri and P. auritus dominated. Their occurrence was connected mainly with old forests of natural tree-species composition. The second group comprised species, which foraged in more open space or along the forest edge (with the farmland) and avoided closed interior (particularly Eptesicus serotinus, N. noctula, Nyctalus leisleri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus). The presence of mountain species Eptesicus nilssonii and Vespertilio murinus was associated mainly with dominance of spruce. Suggested predictive modelling of species composition in forest bat assemblages in conditions of natural forests can help in nature conservation.},

In this study, we investigate the statistical properties of the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable labeles, we first show that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese finch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one previous syllable. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that higher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden state transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large range of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these models with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual annotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and surpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model; GMM), which does not use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical representation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural implementation for generating complex behavioral sequences with higher-order dependencies.},

Lateral transfer obscures the phylogenetic signal in the data as the histories of affected traits are mosaics of the overall phylogeny. We control for the effect of lateral transfer in a Stochastic Dollo model and a Bayesian setting. Our likelihood is highly intractable as the parameters are the solution of a sequence of large systems of differential equations representing the expected evolution of traits along a tree. We illustrate our method on a data set of lexical traits in Eastern Polynesian languages and obtain an improved fit over the corresponding model without lateral transfer.},

 abstract = {Die meisten Tafelenten aus Grossbritanien wurden zwischen November und M{\"a}rz beringt. Diejenigen, die ausserhalb Grossbritanien beringt wurden, wurden zum Hauptteil w{\"a}hrend der Brutzeit beringt. Zwischen 1960 und 1990 nahm die Zahl an in Latvia beringten Tafelenten zu. Es gibt Hinweise auf eine steigende Population in Latvia. Tafelenten, die w{\"a}hrend der Brutzeit in Grossbritanien beringt wurden, {\"u}berwintern hautps{\"a}chlich auf Grossbritannien, Frankreich oder seltener in Spanien. Im Herbst ziehen britische V{\"o}gel nach Westen und Norden, Weibchen etwas weiter als M{\"a}nnchen. V{\"o}gel, die w{\"a}hrend der Brutzeit in Grossbritanien beringt wurden, wurden in einer sp{\"a}teren Brutsaison in Sibirien, Finland, Estland, Niederlanden, Polen, Weissrussland und England gefunden. Es ist unklar, ob dies ein Austausch zwischen den Brutpopulationen anzeigt. Mehr Ringfunde sind n{\"o}tig, um dies zu belegen. Die auf Grossbritanien {\"u}berwinternden Tafelenten kommen haupts{\"a}chlich aus den Baltischen Staaten, ehem. Russland, Sommereinf{\"a}lle (mausernde M{\"a}nnchen) finden auf Grossbritannien in unregelm{\"a}ssigen Abst{\"a}nden statt. V{\"o}gel, die im Winter auf GB beringt wurden, sind in einem darauffolgenden Winter in Frankreich, Yugoslawien usw. gefunden worden. Es existiert eine grosse Wanderung zwischen den Wintern und innerhalb des Winters (sehr geringe Winterortstreue). Tafelente zeigt starke Wetterfluchten. Differential migration: females {\"u}berwintern s{\"u}dlicher als M{\"a}nnchen.},

 abstract = {... in most species a higher proportion of juveniles was recorded. This may be due to adults generally winterin g further north or being less inclined to follow leading lines. Three species (Honey Buzzard, Rough-legged Buzzard and Peregrine Falco peregrinus) showed a higher percentage of adults. In these species I suggest the adults use their previous experience to folloow established safe and efficient routes to their knowwn winter quarters.

@article{Kleiman.1969,
 abstract = {Insectivorous bats have rarely been considered suitable as breeding laboratory animals despite their unique reproductive physiology. The purpose of this study was to compare maternal care and growth of young in several species of British vespertilionids in order to find one or more species that would adapt well to conditions of captivity. During the spring of 1966 and of 1967, 17 noctule (Nyctalus noctula Schreber), eight serotine (Eptesicus serotinus, Schreber), 33 pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Schreber), and four long-eared (Plecotus auritus, Linnaeus) bats were brought into the laboratory after insemination or when pregnant, and most gave birth. One noctule mated in the laboratory in the autumn of 1966 and gave birth to twins in June 1967, thus providing the first known breeding record of any British vespertilionid in captivity. Noctules (13) housed in near natural conditions with limited food gave birth four weeks after others (four) fed ad lib. and housed in a room which buffered the changes in external temperature, and two long-eared bats gave birth in late May (the normal birth season is June to July). These early births may have resulted from premature ovulations and/or a shortened gestation. Fourteen of 17 live-born noctules, all live-bom serotines (four), 12 of 14 live-born pipistrelles, and none of the long-eared bats were reared to weaning age. As part of maternal care all females allogroomed and retrieved their young until the second week post-partum, and recognition of offspring seemed to be effected primarily by sound and individual odour. Neonates of three species were about 20{\%} of the mother's weight at birth and doubled their weight by the end of the second week. Forearm growth ceased at approximately five weeks of age. Weaning, which was assisted, was completed by the end of the second month and adult weight was reached soon thereafter. The development of the three species, i.e. the opening of the eyes, hair growth, and the replacement of the deciduous teeth, differed, and the pipistrelles and serotines developed more rapidly than the noctules.},

@article{Koch.2018,
 abstract = {Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and impairments in its signaling are associated with many neurological disorders, including Huntington's Disease (HD). Previous studies in HD mouse models demonstrate altered glutamate receptor distribution and signaling at cortico-striatal synapses, and some studies suggest glutamate release is altered; however, traditional methods to study synaptic glutamate release are indirect or have poor temporal resolution. Here we utilize iGluSnFR, a modified GFP reporter for real-time imaging of glutamate transmission, to study presynaptic modulation of cortical glutamate release in the striatum of the YAC128 HD mouse model. We determined that iGluSnFR can be used to accurately measure short- and long-term changes in glutamate release caused by modulation of extracellular Ca2+ levels, activation of presynaptic receptors, and high frequency stimulation (HFS) protocols. We also confirmed a difference in the expression of HFS-induced long-term depression in YAC128. Together, this research demonstrates the utility of iGluSnFR in studying presynaptic modulation of glutamate release in healthy mice and disease models that display impairments in glutamate signalling.},

The two most common explanations are the rank advantage hypothesis, in which male-male competition for breeding sites drives stronger selection for early arrival in males than females, and the mate opportunity hypothesis, which relies on sexual selection, as early arrival improves prospects of mate acquisition more for males than for females. 2. To date, theoretical work has focused on selection for early arrival within a single sex, usually male. However, if fitness depends on territory quality, selection for early arrival should operate on both sexes. Here we use two independent modelling approaches to explore the evolution of protandry (male-first arrival) and protogyny (female-first arrival) under the rank advantage and mate opportunity hypotheses. 3. The rank advantage hypothesis, when operating alone, fails to produce consistent patterns of protandry, despite our assumption that males must occupy territories before females. This is because an individual of either sex benefits if it out-competes same-sex competitors. Rather than promoting protandry, the rank advantage mechanism can sometimes result in protogyny. Female-female competition is stronger than male-male competition early in the season, if females compete for a resource (territories occupied by males) that is initially less common than the resource of interest to males (unoccupied territories). 4. Our results support the mate opportunity hypothesis as an explanation of why protandry is the norm in migratory systems. Male-biased adult sex ratios and high levels of sperm competition (modelled as extra-pair young: EPY) both produce protandry as a result of sexual selection. Protogyny is only observed in our models with female-biased sex ratios and low EPY production. 5. We also show that the effects of sex ratio biases are much stronger than those of EPY production, explore the evidence for sex ratio biases and extra-pair paternity in migratory species and suggest future research directions.},

@article{Koons.2017,
 abstract = {Identifying the demographic parameters (e.g., reproduction, survival, dispersal) that most influence population dynamics can increase conservation effectiveness and enhance ecological understanding. Life table response experiments (LTRE) aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters on past demographic outcomes (e.g., population growth rates). But the vast majority of LTREs and other retrospective population analyses have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates, which do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates (\textgreek{l}t=Nt+1/Nt) in time-varying environments. We provide an empirical means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed {\dq}transient life-table response experiments{\dq} with integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the estimation of latent population structure and other demographic parameters that are required for transient LTRE analysis, and Bayesian versions additionally allow for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and perturbation analyses of growth rates. By integrating available monitoring data for Lesser Scaup over 60~yr, and conducting transient LTREs on IPM estimates, we found that the contribution of juvenile female survival to long-term variation in realized population growth rates was 1.6 and 3.7 times larger than that of adult female survival and fecundity, respectively. But a persistent long-term decline in fecundity explained 92{\%} of the decline in abundance between 1983 and 2006. In contrast, an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest recovery in Lesser Scaup abundance since 2006, indicating that the most important demographic drivers of Lesser Scaup population dynamics are temporally dynamic. In addition to resolving uncertainty about Lesser Scaup population dynamics, the merger of IPMs with transient LTREs will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non-stationary global change.},

@phdthesis{Krattli.01.01.2001,
 abstract = {Das wichtigste in bezug zu meiner Diss:

Untersuchte Arten: Muridae

Def: Kletterleistung = kleinster, gerade noch bekletterbarer Astdurchmesser


Korrelationen zwischen Kletterleistungen und Fussmorphologie:


· Fussl{\"a}nge ist weder mit der Astdicke noch mit der Kletterh{\"a}ufigkeit korreliert. 

· Je st{\"a}rker die Krallen gebeugt sind, desto h{\"a}ufiger klettert die Maus und desto h{\"o}her ist ihre Kletterleistung.

· Die Gr{\"o}sse des zweiten Tarsalballens und der Terminalballen des Hinterfusses sind positiv und gut mit den Kletterleistungen auf vertikalen {\"A}sten korreliert und alle Ballengr{\"o}ssen sind positiv mit den Kletterh{\"a}ufigkeiten korreliert. Sehr d{\"u}nne {\"A}ste werden beim Greifklettern zwischen Terminal- und Tarsalballen (bzw. Carpalballen am Vorderfuss) eingeklemmt. Nebst der Ballengr{\"o}sse spielt vermutlich die Ballenform eine wichtige Rolle f{\"u}r die Kletterf{\"a}higkeit.

· Je feiner die Leisten sind, desto mehr wird der Haftreibungskoeffizient erh{\"o}ht, weil sich feine Leisten in kleinere Strukturen des Untergrundes pressen k{\"o}nnen. Aufgrund der Feinheit der Leisten bzw. ihrer Anzahl auf einem Ballen kann deshalb auf die Kletterf{\"a}hgigkeit einer Art geschlossen werden.

· Sowohl in den Ballen des Vorderfusses als auch bei denjenigen des Hinterfusses bestehen enge positive Korrelationen zwischen dem Volumen ekkriner Dr{\"u}sen in den Fussballen und den Kletterleistungen (v. a. auf geneigten {\"A}sten). 

· Die Dichte ovn Ausf{\"u}hrg{\"a}ngen in den Ballen ist ebenfalls ein Kriterium daf{\"u}r, wie gut und wie h{\"a}ufig ein Vertreter der Muridae klettert. 

· Fettgewebe, Muskulatur, Knorpel und Knochen weisen sehr hohe innerartliche Variablilit{\"a}t auf.

· Sowohl bei den Ballen des Vorderfusses als auch bei denjenigen des Hinterfusses konnten durchwegs positive Korrelationen zwischen der Dichte Meissner'scher Tastk{\"o}rperchen und den Kletterleistungen (v.a. auf horizontalen {\"A}sten) nachgewiesen werden.

· Die Anzahl und Anordnung von Vater-Paccini-K{\"o}rperchen in den F{\"u}ssen weisen eine hohe interspezifische Variabilit{\"a}t auf.

· Spezialisierte Kletterer besitzen am Hinterfuss Tasthaare.

· Die Anzahl Schilder auf der Zehenunterseite ist bei guten Kletterern h{\"o}her.

· Bei spezialisierten Kletterern ist die distale Phalanx der Zehen dorso-caudad abgewinkelt, um einer Abnutzung der Kralle vorzubeugen.


In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde erstmals ein Mapping von Meissner'schen Tastk{\"o}rperchen f{\"u}r einen nicht-menschlichen Organismus angefertigt.

F{\"u}r Rattus rattus und Apodemus flavicollis konnte erstmals einen Sehnenklemmmechanismus nachgewiesen werden.},

 abstract = {This study examines the anatomical structure, function and seasonal cyclicity of the male and female reproductive organs of the cave myotis (Myotis velifer) in Texas and southern Arizona. The data indicated that this is a monestrous, seasonally breeding species that stores spermatozoa in both sexes during extended winter torpor or hibernation. The male reproductive cycle was characterized by asynchronous function of the testes (spermatogenesis) and accessory sex organs. Structural factors in both sexes and fructose levels in male accessory organs were evaluated for their significance in prolonged spermatozoa storage. The reproductive anatomy and chronology were similar to other temperate-dwelling vespertilionid bats. Dextral dominance was a feature of the female reproductive tract.},

Males were more common in the netting sample than females among silver-haired bats (88{\%}; n  =  57) and eastern red bats (70{\%}; n  =  458), whereas male and female hoary bats (n  =  40) were equally abundant. Silver-haired bats and male hoary bats were more common north of a line separating the Deciduous Forest Biome and a transition to the Coniferous Forest Biome. The presence of male-dominated populations of all species at low-elevation sites in northern Lower Michigan suggested that distribution of the sexes in each species is more complex than previously thought. The sex ratio of adult eastern red bats was more skewed in July (74{\%} male) than in June (58{\%}), which might indicate late northward migration by males.},

@article{Kusch.2007,
 abstract = {We monitored echolocation calls to measure the flight and foraging activity of European bats at twenty-four locations in the Palatinate Forest, Germany. Bats' flight activities correlated with their foraging activities at different sites. The distribution of bat foraging sites may be patchy even in a continuous forest habitat. Pipistrelle bats changed some of their foraging patches during the summer-season, most probably due to temporal differences of the resource densities at those patches. Daubenton's bats in contrast showed steadily high activities at two investigated forest lakes. The feeding buzz rate declined during five hours of nightly bat foraging. The nocturnal bat activity did not change significantly during this time, with the exception of few patches. Food resources as well as additional factors, like acoustical landmarks that enable orienting of echolocating bats, and habitat features that allow special foraging strategies should influence the quality of patches and their use by bats. The use of one, or of different foraging patches during the year, may depend on the seasonal constancy or variability of resources, on the degree of isolation of a patch type, and on the species specific foraging strategy.},

 abstract = {Arctic amplification, the accelerated climate warming in the polar regions, is causing a more rapid advancement of the onset of spring in the Arctic than in temperate regions. Consequently, the arrival of many migratory birds in the Arctic is thought to become increasingly mismatched with the onset of local spring, consequently reducing individual fitness and potentially even population levels. We used a dynamic state variable model to study whether Arctic long-distance migrants can advance their migratory schedules under climate warming scenarios which include Arctic amplification, and whether such an advancement is constrained by fuel accumulation or the ability to anticipate climatic changes. Our model predicts that barnacle geese Branta leucopsis suffer from considerably reduced reproductive success with increasing Arctic amplification through mistimed arrival, when they cannot anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring from their wintering grounds. When geese are able to anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring, they are predicted to advance their spring arrival under Arctic amplification up to 44 days without any reproductive costs in terms of optimal condition or timing of breeding. Negative effects of mistimed arrival on reproduction are predicted to be somewhat mitigated by increasing summer length under warming in the Arctic, as late arriving geese can still breed successfully. We conclude that adaptation to Arctic amplification may rather be constrained by the (un)predictability of changes in the Arctic spring than by the time available for fuel accumulation. Social migrants like geese tend to have a high behavioural plasticity regarding stopover site choice and migration schedule, giving them the potential to adapt to future climate changes on their flyway.},

@article{LaSorte.2017,
 abstract = {Understanding the susceptibility of highly mobile taxa such as migratory birds to global change requires information on geographic patterns of occurrence across the annual cycle. Neotropical migrants that breed in North America and winter in Central America occur in high concentrations on their non-breeding grounds where they spend the majority of the year and where habitat loss has been associated with population declines. Here, we use eBird data to model weekly patterns of abundance and occurrence for 21 forest passerine species that winter in Central America. We estimate species' distributional dynamics across the annual cycle, which we use to determine how species are currently associated with public protected areas and projected changes in climate and land-use. The effects of global change on the non-breeding grounds is characterized by decreasing precipitation, especially during the summer, and the conversion of forest to cropland, grassland, or peri-urban. The effects of global change on the breeding grounds are characterized by increasing winter precipitation, higher temperatures, and the conversion of forest to peri-urban. During spring and autumn migration, species are projected to encounter higher temperatures, forests that have been converted to peri-urban, and increased precipitation during spring migration. Based on current distributional dynamics, susceptibility to global change is characterized by the loss of forested habitats on the non-breeding grounds, warming temperatures during migration and on the breeding grounds, and declining summer rainfall on the non-breeding grounds. Public protected areas with low and medium protection status are more prevalent on the non-breeding grounds, suggesting that management opportunities currently exist to mitigate near-term non-breeding habitat losses. These efforts would affect more individuals of more species during a longer period of the annual cycle, which may create additional opportunities for species to respond to changes in habitat or phenology that are likely to develop under climate change.},

@article{Lausen.2006,
 abstract = {Abstract Individuals of some species of bats roost in human-made structures despite the apparent availability of natural roosts. We compared patterns of thermoregulation in relation to microclimate and compared reproductive timing for maternity colonies of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) roosting in natural and building roosts in the prairies of southeastern Alberta. During pregnancy, bats roosting in buildings used torpor less frequently than did rock-roosting bats, but achieved lower body temperatures when torpid. Less-frequent use of torpor leaves more active days for fetal development, and bats in building roosts gave birth earlier than those in rock roosts. We observed predators and predation in rock roosts, but not in building roosts, and suggest that bats roosting in rocks use shallower torpor to remain vigilant. Patterns of torpor use suggest that bats in buildings save more energy than rock-roosting individuals by roosting in the warmer microenvironments of buildings and by achieving lower body temperatures when ambient conditions are cold and foraging is not productive. The warmer building roosts are also conducive to juvenile growth, and young building-roosting bats fledged 1--2 weeks before rock bats. We propose that advantages for bats roosting in buildings (lower predation risk, earlier births, faster juvenile growth rates, and increased energy savings) lead to greater long-term reproductive success for building-roosting bats and make buildings preferred roosts.},

@article{Lawson.2014,
 abstract = {The importance of wild bird populations as a reservoir of zoonotic pathogens is well established. Salmonellosis is a frequently diagnosed infectious cause of mortality of garden birds in England and Wales, predominantly caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium definitive phage types 40, 56(v) and 160. In Britain, these phage types are considered highly host-adapted with a high degree of genetic similarity amongst isolates, and in some instances are clonal. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis, however, demonstrated minimal variation amongst matched DT40 and DT56(v) isolates derived from passerine and human incidents of salmonellosis across England in 2000-2007. Also, during the period 1993-2012, similar temporal and spatial trends of infection with these S. Typhimurium phage types occurred in both the British garden bird and human populations; 1.6{\%} of all S. Typhimurium (0.2{\%} of all Salmonella) isolates from humans in England and Wales over the period 2000-2010. These findings support the hypothesis that garden birds act as the primary reservoir of infection for these zoonotic bacteria. Most passerine salmonellosis outbreaks identified occurred at and around feeding stations, which are likely sites of public exposure to sick or dead garden birds and their faeces. We, therefore, advise the public to practise routine personal hygiene measures when feeding wild birds and especially when handling sick wild birds.},

@article{Lehikoinen.2019,
 abstract = {Mountain areas often hold special species communities, and they are high on the list of conservation concern. Global warming and changes in human land use, such as grazing pressure and afforestation, have been suggested to be major threats for biodiversity in the mountain areas, affecting species abundance and causing distribution shifts towards mountaintops. Population shifts towards poles and mountaintops have been documented in several areas, indicating that climate change is one of the key drivers of species' distribution changes. Despite the high conservation concern, relatively little is known about the population trends of species in mountain areas due to low accessibility and difficult working conditions. Thanks to the recent improvement of bird monitoring schemes around Europe, we can here report a first account of population trends of 44 bird species from four major European mountain regions: Fennoscandia, UK upland, south-western (Iberia) and south-central mountains (Alps), covering 12 countries. Overall, the mountain bird species declined significantly (-7{\%}) during 2002-2014, which is similar to the declining rate in common birds in Europe during the same period. Mountain specialists showed a significant -10{\%} decline in population numbers. The slope for mountain generalists was also negative, but not significantly so. The slopes of specialists and generalists did not differ from each other. Fennoscandian and Iberian populations were on average declining, while in United Kingdom and Alps, trends were nonsignificant. Temperature change or migratory behaviour was not significantly associated with regional population trends of species. Alpine habitats are highly vulnerable to climate change, and this is certainly one of the main drivers of mountain bird population trends. However, observed declines can also be partly linked with local land use practices. More efforts should be undertaken to identify the causes of decline and to increase conservation efforts for these populations.},

Ecologists are already aware that small sample sizes increase the probability of committing Type II errors. In this article, we address a relatively unknown problem with low power: underpowered studies must overestimate small effect sizes in order to achieve statistical significance. First, we describe how low replication coupled with weak effect sizes leads to Type M errors, or exaggerated effect sizes. We then conduct a meta-analysis to determine the average statistical power and Type M error rate for manipulative field experiments that address important questions related to global change; global warming, biodiversity loss, and drought. Finally, we provide recommendations for avoiding Type M errors and constraining estimates of effect size from underpowered studies.},

Total numbers of the bat assemblage, which consisted of 11 species, increased within the study period from 178 to 1477 individuals in the first decade to 835--2902 in the past decade of the study, with the highest rates of increase noted in Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus and Myotis nattereri. Myotis myotis and Myotis daubentonii showed only slight upward trends. In the years 2009--2010, Myotis bechsteinii occurred in markedly higher numbers (up to 24 individuals) as compared to previous years.},

 abstract = {Across a range of organisms, related species or even populations of the same species exhibit strikingly different scales and patterns of movement. A significant proportion of the phenotypic variance in migratory traits is genetic, but the genes involved in shaping these phenotypes are still unknown. Although recent achievements in genomics will evolve migratory genetics research from a phenotypic to a molecular approach, fully sequenced and annotated genomes of migratory species are still lacking. Consequently, many of the genes involved in migration are unavailable as candidates. Migration is central to the life-history adaptations of many animals. Here, we review current understanding of the genetic architecture of migratory traits and discuss the significant implications this will have for other areas of biology, including population responses to climate change, speciation and conservation management.},

@article{Loh.2005,
 abstract = {The Living Planet Index was developed to measure the changing state of the world's biodiversity over time. It uses time-series data to calculate average rates of change in a large number of populations of terrestrial, freshwater and marine vertebrate species. The dataset contains about 3000 population time series for over 1100 species. Two methods of calculating the index are outlined: the chain method and a method based on linear modelling of log-transformed data. The dataset is analysed to compare the relative representation of biogeographic realms, ecoregional biomes, threat status and taxonomic groups among species contributing to the index. The two methods show very similar results: terrestrial species declined on average by 25{\%} from 1970 to 2000. Birds and mammals are over-represented in comparison with other vertebrate classes, and temperate species are over-represented compared with tropical species, but there is little difference in representation between threatened and non-threatened species. Some of the problems arising from over-representation are reduced by the way in which the index is calculated. It may be possible to reduce this further by post-stratification and weighting, but new information would first need to be collected for data-poor classes, realms and biomes.},

@article{Looft.2003,
 abstract = {In einer Langzeituntersuchung von 31 Jahren (1970/71 bis 2001/02) wurden in der Sorgeniederung, im mittleren Westen Schleswig-Holsteins, die Best{\"a}nde des M{\"a}usebussards im Winterhalbjahr erfa{\ss}t (Abb. 1). F{\"u}r die erheblichen, jahrweisen Schwankungen der Best{\"a}nde zwischen etwa 20 und 400 Exemplaren im 33 km2 gro{\ss}en Untersuchungsgebiet werden in erster Linie die Populationsschwankungen der Feldm{\"a}use (Microtus arvalis) verantwortlich sein.

Der enorme Bestandsanstieg der Bussarde in den Wintern ab 1989 zeigte eine auffallende Parallelentwicklung zur Fl{\"a}chenstilllegung in Schleswig-Holstein, die von der Europ{\"a}ischen Gemeinschaft initiiert worden ist. So konnten die M{\"a}usebussard-Brutpaare auf den Ackerstandorten zunehmen, was besonders auf eine Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen f{\"u}r Feldm{\"a}use und damit auf eine Erh{\"o}hung ihrer Best{\"a}nde zur{\"u}ckgef{\"u}rt wird. Zudem wurden die Lebensgrundlagen der Feldm{\"a}use auch in der Gr{\"u}nlandniederung an der Sorge, dem Untersuchungsgebiet, verbessert. Zum einen vergr{\"o}{\ss}erte sich hier durch Ankauf seitens der Stiftung {\dq}Naturschutz Schleswig-Holstein{\dq} die - extensiv oder gar nicht bewirtschaftete - Naturschutzfl{\"a}che (auf ca. 1.300 ha in Abb. 2), zum anderen kam es zu einer Verbesserung der Entw{\"a}sserungssysteme, die eine {\dq}Wiesenvogellandschaft{\dq} in ein {\dq}Feldmausgr{\"u}nland{\dq} wandelte.

Zusammenfassend wird angenommen, dass alle drei Umweltparameter in Kombination und in unterschiedlicher St{\"a}rke auf die Entwicklung der M{\"a}usebussard-Winterbest{\"a}nde in der Sorgeniederung Einflu{\ss} genommen haben.

Die Herkunft der M{\"a}usebussarde im Untersuchungsgebiet wird diskutiert. Beringungsergebnisse und die ermittelten Brutpaar- und Jungenzahlen aus der n{\"a}heren Umgebung lassen vermuten, dass {\"u}berwiegend heimische Bussarde den Winterbestand ausmachen, die von der Landschaftsgestaltung in unserem Land beeinflu{\ss}t werden. Skandinavische Bussarde scheinen nur einen kleinen Anteil an unserem Winterbestand zu stellen. Dabei weisen die Ergebnisse der Beobachtungsstation Helleb{\ae}k/Nordseeland/DK, deren M{\"a}usebussarde auf ihrem Zugweg nach S{\"u}dwesten eher unser Untersuchungsgebiet erreichen k{\"o}nnten, st{\"a}rkere Parallelen zu den Herbst- und Winterbest{\"a}nden in der Sorgeniederung auf als die von Falsterbo/S{\"u}dschweden},

@article{Louvrier.2019,
 abstract = {As large carnivores recover throughout Europe, their distribution needs to be studied to determine their conservation status and assess the potential for human-carnivore conflicts. However, efficient monitoring of many large carnivore species is challenging due to their rarity, elusive behavior, and large home ranges. Their monitoring can include opportunistic sightings from citizens in addition to designed surveys. Two types of detection errors may occur in such monitoring schemes: false negatives and false positives. False-negative detections can be accounted for in species distribution models (SDMs) that deal with imperfect detection. False-positive detections, due to species misidentification, have rarely been accounted for in SDMs. Generally, researchers use ad hoc data-filtering methods to discard ambiguous observations prior to analysis. These practices may discard valuable ecological information on the distribution of a species. We investigated the costs and benefits of including data types that may include false positives rather than discarding them for SDMs of large carnivores. We used a dynamic occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for false negatives and positives to jointly analyze data that included both unambiguous detections and ambiguous detections. We used simulations to compare the performances of our model with a model fitted on unambiguous data only. We tested the 2 models in 4 scenarios in which parameters that control false-positive detections and true detections varied. We applied our model to data from the monitoring of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the European Alps. The addition of ambiguous detections increased the precision of parameter estimates. For the Eurasian lynx, incorporating ambiguous detections produced more precise estimates of the ecological parameters and revealed additional occupied sites in areas where the species is likely expanding. Overall, we found that ambiguous data should be considered when studying the distribution of large carnivores through the use of dynamic occupancy models that account for misidentification.},

5. Mating and migration systems of many diving ducks (Aythya spp.) may disrupt genetic adaptations to specific wintering conditions because (i) pairbonds are mostly formed during spring migration so that mates have often wintered in different areas, (ii)offspring disperse to diverse wintering sites often different from those of their parents, and (iii) ducks often move long distances during winter in response to weather.

 abstract = {Body size is directly linked to key life history traits such as growth, fecundity, and survivorship. Identifying the causes of body size variation is a critical task in ecological and evolutionary research. Body size variation along altitudinal gradients has received considerable attention; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we compared the growth rate and age structure of toad-headed lizards (Phrynocephalus vlangalii) from two populations found at different elevations in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We used mark-recapture and skeletochronological analysis to identify the potential proximate causes of altitudinal variation in body size. Lizards from the high-elevation site had higher growth rates and attained slightly larger adult body sizes than lizards from the low-elevation site. However, newborns produced by high-elevation females were smaller than those by low-elevation females. Von Bertalanffy growth estimates predicted high-elevation individuals would reach sexual maturity at an earlier age and have a lower mean age than low-elevation individuals. Relatively lower mean age for the high-elevation population was confirmed using the skeletochronological analysis. These results support the prediction that a larger adult body size of high-elevation P.~vlangalii results from higher growth rates, associated with higher resource availability.},

@article{Lucan.2009,
 abstract = {The few studies that have assessed the long-term patterns of re-use of tree cavities by bats all concern North American bats. We studied long-term re-use of tree cavities by two species of European bat, Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) and noctules (Nyctalus noctula). Cavities were inspected during consecutive years via direct capture of bats (more than 340 positive capture events, ca 2950 captured bats), observations of emerging bats, or by listening for bats during the early evening when bats emit typical vocalization (over 160 positive checks, over 450 observed bats). Between 1968 and 2007, we found 80 tree cavities used by bats (mostly excavated by woodpeckers) in the Czech Republic. Although more than half of the cavities were occupied for $\leq$4 summers, 28 cavities (35{\%}) were re-used for 5--10 years. The longest period a cavity was used was 11 and 16 years for Daubenton's and noctule bats, respectively. Sixteen tree cavities (20{\%}) were occupied solely by Daubenton's bats and 33 cavities (41{\%}) were occupied only by noctules. The other 31 cavities (39{\%}) were used by both species, either at separate times or simultaneously. Our data suggest that the larger volume of a cavity, the longer duration of re-use and the greater the probability of being occupied by both species. Continuous excavation of cavities by woodpeckers prevented the overgrowth of old cavities by calluses, which keep cavities accessible to bats. We suggest that woodpeckers may be the most important providers of suitable roosts for forest bats in Central Europe. Roosts were found in both economically valuable trees (Quercus robur and Tilia cordata) and less valuable tree species (Salix fragilis and Alnus glutinuosa). Economically valuable trees in our study area were long-lived and likely provide roosting habitat for longer periods but matured at a greater age. However, less economically valuable trees reached maturity and started to decay in a relatively short time, which may provide suitable cavities at a younger age. Maintaining both types of trees within forests may help provide suitable roosting oportunities for tree-dwelling bats in the Czech Republic.},

@article{Lucan.2013,
 abstract = {We used long-term datasets to analyse (1) the patterns of covariation between basic climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and the timing of reproduction and reproductive success; and (2) long-term trends in both reproductive parameters of a maternity colony of Daubenton's bats Myotis daubentonii in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The mean April temperature was the best predictor of the timing of reproduction. The higher the April temperature, the earlier the first neonates appeared. The mean date of first parturition was June 4, but it advanced significantly by c. 11 days between 1970 and 2012. Similarly, the mean April temperature increased over the study period by c. 2.7°C. Between 1999 and 2012, the mean reproductive success (proportion of reproductive females) was 74{\%}, but varied between 33{\%} (2009) and 93{\%} (2006). It was negatively related to May--July precipitation. Thus, reproductive success was lower in years with increased rainfall. Given the published evidence that advancement in parturition is positively related to survival of juvenile bats rising spring temperatures may have a beneficial influence on the population dynamics of Daubenton's bats. However, increased incidence of climatic extremes, such as excessive summer rainfall, may largely buffer this effect. Consequently, populations of temperate insectivorous bats may experience increasing environmental stress under continuing climate change.},

@article{Lundy.2010,
 abstract = {Aim To examine the effect of climate change on the occurrence and distribution of Pipistrellus nathusii (Nathusius' pipistrelle) in the United Kingdom (UK). Location We modelled habitat and climatic associations of P. nathusii in the UK and applied this model to the species' historical range in continental Europe. Methods A binomial logistic regression model was constructed relating the occurrence of P. nathusii to climate and habitat characteristics using historical species occurrence records (1940--2006) and CORINE land cover data. This model was applied to historical and projected climate data to examine changes in suitable range (1940--2080) of this species. We tested the predictive ability of the model with known records in the UK after 2006 and applied the model to the species' known range in Europe. Results The distribution of P. nathusii was related positively to the area of water bodies, woodland and small areas of urbanization, and negatively related to the area of peat/heathland. Species records were associated with higher minimum temperatures, low seasonal variation in temperature and intermediate rainfall. We found that suitable areas have existed in the UK since the 1940s and that these have expanded. The model had high predictive power when applied to new records after 2006, with a correct classification rate of 70{\%}, estimated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Based on climate projections, our model suggests a potential twofold increase in the area suitable for P. nathusii in the UK by 2050. The single most influential climate variable contributing to range increase was the projected increase in minimum temperature. When applied to Europe, the model predictions had best predictive capability of known records in western areas of the species' range, where P. nathusii is present during the winter. Main conclusions We show that a mobile, migratory species has adapted its range in response to recent climate change on a continental scale. We believe this may be the first study to demonstrate a case of range change linked to contemporary climate change in a mammal species in Europe.},

@article{Mackie.2007,
 abstract = {Many temperate zone bat species form colonies during the highly synchronised summer breeding period allowing differences in foraging behaviour to be compared between females in different reproductive states. Such comparisons may clarify mechanisms of population regulation. Individual female (n = 20) noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) from the same colony, but in different reproductive states (lactating or non-lactating), were radiotracked and their use of foraging space, in relation to available habitat types, assessed and compared. Habitat preference was determined using compositional analysis on two levels: overall preference within the minimum convex polygon (MCP) used by the colony (total area 62.75 km2) and overall preference within individual bat MCPs (mean area 8.2 km2). A further comparison of relative habitat use, between lactating and non-lactating bats, demonstrated state-dependent differences in use and identified habitats important for foraging in reproducing bats. Broadleaved woodland and pasture were the highest ranked foraging habitats consistently preferred by noctule bats across both levels. Although there was little difference in foraging activity (e.g. nightly duration, median 115 min) or maximum distances travelled to foraging grounds (mean 4.23 km), non-lactating bats used less preferred marginal habitats (arable land and moorland) significantly more than lactating bats. The observed spatial partitioning is discussed in relation to density dependence and the conservation implications of changing land use for bat populations.},

@article{MacLeod.2006,
 abstract = {House sparrow (Passer domesticus) numbers have declined rapidly in both rural and urban habitats across Western Europe over the last 30 years, leading to their inclusion on the UK conservation red list. The decline in farmland has been linked to a reduction in winter survival caused by reduced food supply. This reduction in food supply is associated with agricultural intensification that has led to the loss of seed-rich winter stubble and access to spilt grain. However, urban house sparrows have also declined, suggesting that reduced food supply in farmland is not the sole reason for the decline. Here, we show that changes in house sparrow mass and thus fat reserves are not regulated to minimize starvation risk, as would be expected if limited winter food were the only cause of population decline. Instead, the species appears to be responding to mass-dependent predation risk, with starvation risk and predation risk traded-off such that house sparrows may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change that reduces the predictability of the food supply.},

 abstract = {The Vitelline Warbler Dendroica vitellina is endemic to the Cayman Islands and Swan Islands in the West Indies. This study examined the phylogenetic affinities of the Vitelline Warbler and assessed mitochondrial differentiation among the three Cayman Island populations. Species-level phylogenetic analyses based on 3639 nucleotides of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence were used to place the Vitelline Warbler in the larger Dendroica radiation. These analyses confirmed that the Vitelline Warbler is the sister taxon of the Prairie Warbler Dendroica discolor, a species that breeds in continental North America. The magnitude of mitochondrial differentiation between these sister taxa (2.4{\%}) supports their current classification as separate taxonomic species. Additional comparisons based on the 1041-nucleotide NDII gene sequence from 26 Vitelline Warblers provided evidence of within-species genetic structure. NDII haplotypes from Grand Cayman vs. Cayman Brac/Little Cayman differed by 6-10 nucleotide substitutions, and no haplotypes were shared among these island groups, supporting the current separation of the Cayman Island populations into two subspecies. These patterns support the biogeographical scenario that the Vitelline Warbler was derived from a mainland population of the Prairie Warbler. This may have occurred due to a loss of migration in ancestral populations or from over-water dispersal of a mainland resident population.},

 abstract = {In this article, we consider the U.K. Common Birds Census counts and their use in monitoring bird abundance. We use a state-space modeling approach within a Bayesian framework to describe population level trends over time and contribute to the alert system used by the British Trust for Ornithology. We account for potential overdispersion and excess zero counts by modeling the observation process with a zero-inflated negative binomial, while the system process is described by second-order polynomial growth models. In order to provide a biological motivation for the amount of smoothing applied to the observed series the system variance is related to the demographic characteristics of the species, so as to help the specification of its prior distribution. In particular, the available information on productivity and survival is used to formulate prior expectations on annual percentage changes in the population level and then used to constrain the variance of the system process. We discuss an example of how to interpret alternative choices for the degree of smoothing and how these relate to the classification of species, over time, into conservation lists.},

@article{McCarthy.2014,
 abstract = {Biodiversity indices often combine data from different species when used in monitoring programs. Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. We developed 3 biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. We based the first index on the geometric mean abundance of species and the second on a more general power mean. In a third index, we integrated the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggested that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1{\%} from 1970 to 2009.},

@article{Medici.2016,
 abstract = {Wilson disease (WD), a genetic disorder affecting copper transport, is characterized by hepatic and neurological manifestations with variable and often unpredictable presentation. Global DNA methylation in liver was previously modified by dietary choline in tx-j mice, a spontaneous mutant model of WD. We therefore hypothesized that the WD phenotype and hepatic gene expression of tx-j offspring could be modified by maternal methyl supplementation during pregnancy. In an initial experiment, female tx-j mice or wild type mice were fed control or choline-supplemented diets 2~weeks prior to mating through embryonic day 17. Transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) on embryonic livers revealed tx-j-specific differences in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the neurological disorders Huntington's disease and Alzheimer disease. Maternal choline supplementation restored the transcript levels of a subset of genes to wild type levels. In a separate experiment, a group of tx-j offspring continued to receive choline-supplemented or control diets, with or without the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA) for 12~weeks until 24~weeks of age. Combined choline supplementation and PCA treatment of 24-week-old tx-j mice was associated with increased liver transcript levels of methionine metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes. Sex differences in gene expression within each treatment group were also observed. These results demonstrate that the transcriptional changes in oxidative phosphorylation and methionine metabolism genes in WD that originate during fetal life are, in part, prevented by prenatal maternal choline supplementation, a finding with potential relevance to preventive treatments of WD.},

@article{Medinas.2013,
 abstract = {Recent studies suggest that roads can significantly impact bat populations. Though bats are one of the most threatened groups of European vertebrates, studies aiming to quantify bat mortality and determine the main factors driving it remain scarce. Between March 16 and October 31 of 2009, we surveyed road-killed bats daily along a 51-km-long transect that incorporates different types of roads in southern Portugal. We found 154 road-killed bats of 11 species. The two most common species in the study area, Pipistrellus kuhlii and P. pygmaeus, were also the most commonly identified road-kill, representing 72 {\%} of the total specimens collected. About two-thirds of the total mortality occurred between mid July and late September, peaking in the second half of August. We also recorded casualties of threatened and rare species, including Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, R. hipposideros, Barbastella barbastellus, and Nyctalus leisleri. These species were found mostly in early autumn, corresponding to the mating and swarming periods. Landscape features were the most important variable subset for explaining bat casualties. Road stretches crossing or in the vicinity of high-quality habitats for bats---including dense Mediterranean woodland (``montado'') areas, water courses with riparian gallery, and water reservoirs---yielded a significantly higher number of casualties. Additionally, more road-killed bats were recorded on high-traffic road stretches with viaducts, in areas of higher bat activity and near known roosts.},

@article{Meillere.2015,
 abstract = {Consistent expanding urbanization dramatically transforms natural habitats and exposes organisms to novel environmental challenges, often leading to reduced species richness and diversity in cities. However, it remains unclear how individuals are affected by the urban environment and how they can or cannot adjust to the specific characteristics of urban life (e.g. food availability). In this study, we used an integrative multi-component approach to investigate the effects of urbanization on the nutritional status of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed several morphological and physiological indices of body condition in both juveniles (early post-fledging) and breeding adults from four sites with different levels of urbanization in France, Western Europe. We found that sparrows in more urbanized habitats have reduced body size and body mass compared to their rural conspecifics. However, we did not find any consistent differences in a number of complementary indices of condition (scaled mass index, muscle score, hematocrit, baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels) between urban and rural birds, indicating that urban sparrows may not be suffering nutritional stress. Our results suggest that the urban environment is unlikely to energetically constrain adult sparrows, although other urban-related variables may constrain them. On the other hand, we found significant difference in juvenile fat scores, suggesting that food types provided to young sparrows differed highly between habitats. In addition to the observed smaller size of urban sparrows, these results suggest that the urban environment is inadequate to satisfy early-life sparrows' nutritional requirements, growth, and development. The urban environment may therefore have life-long consequences for developing birds.},

@article{Miller.2013,
 abstract = {Large-scale presence-absence monitoring programs have great promise for many conservation applications. Their value can be limited by potential incorrect inferences owing to observational errors, especially when data are collected by the public. To combat this, previous analytical methods have focused on addressing non-detection from public survey data. Misclassification errors have received less attention but are also likely to be a common component of public surveys, as well as many other data types. We derive estimators for dynamic occupancy parameters (extinction and colonization), focusing on the case where certainty can be assumed for a subset of detections. We demonstrate how to simultaneously account for non-detection (false negatives) and misclassification (false positives) when estimating occurrence parameters for gray wolves in northern Montana from 2007-2010. Our primary data source for the analysis was observations by deer and elk hunters, reported as part of the state's annual hunter survey. This data was supplemented with data from known locations of radio-collared wolves. We found that occupancy was relatively stable during the years of the study and wolves were largely restricted to the highest quality habitats in the study area. Transitions in the occupancy status of sites were rare, as occupied sites almost always remained occupied and unoccupied sites remained unoccupied. Failing to account for false positives led to over estimation of both the area inhabited by wolves and the frequency of turnover. The ability to properly account for both false negatives and false positives is an important step to improve inferences for conservation from large-scale public surveys. The approach we propose will improve our understanding of the status of wolf populations and is relevant to many other data types where false positives are a component of observations.},

@article{Millon.2019,
 abstract = {The demography of a population is often reduced to the apparent (or local) survival of individuals and their realised fecundity within a study area defined according to logistical constraints rather than landscape features. Such demographics are then used to infer whether a local population contributes positively to population dynamics across a wider landscape context. Such a simplistic approach ignores a fundamental process underpinning population dynamics: dispersal. Indeed, it has long been accepted that immigration contributed by dispersers that emigrated from neighbouring populations may strongly influence the net growth of a local population. To date however, we lack a clear picture of how widely immigration rate varies both among and within populations, in relation to extrinsic and intrinsic ecological conditions, even for the best-studied avian and mammalian populations. This empirical knowledge gap precludes the emergence of a sound conceptual framework that ought to inform conservation and population ecology. This review, conducted on both birds and mammals, has thus three complementary objectives. First, we describe and evaluate the relative merits of methods used to quantify immigration and how they relate to widely applicable metrics. We identify two simple and unifying metrics to measure immigration: the immigration rate it defined as the ratio of the number of immigrants present in the population at time t~+~1 and the total breeding population in year t, and \textgreek{p}t , the proportion of immigrants among new recruits (i.e. new breeders). Two recently developed methods are likely to provide the most valuable data on immigration in the near future: individual parentage (rather than population) assignments based on genetic sampling, and spatially explicit integrated population models combining multiple sources of demographic data (survival, fecundity and population counts). Second, we report on a systematic literature review of studies providing a quantitative measure of immigration. Although the diversity of methods employed precludes detailed analyses, it appears that the number of immigrants exceeds locally born individuals in recruitment for most avian populations (median \textgreek{p}t ~=~0.57, N~=~45 estimates from 37 studies), a figure twofold higher than estimated for mammalian populations (median \textgreek{p}t ~=~0.26, N~=~33 estimates from 11 studies). Third, recent quantitative studies reveal that immigration can be the main driver of temporal variation in population growth rates, across a wide array of demographic and spatial contexts. To what extent immigration acts as a regulatory process has however been considered only rarely to date and deserves more attention. Overall, it is likely that most populations benefit from immigrants without necessarily being sink populations. Furthermore, we suggest that quantitative estimates of immigration should be core to future demographic studies and plead for more empirical evidence about the ways in which immigration interacts with local demographic processes to shape population dynamics. Finally, we discuss how to tackle spatial population dynamics by exploring, beyond the classical source-sink framework, the extent to which populations exchange individuals according to spatial scale and type of population distribution throughout the landscape.},

@article{Monaghan.2008,
 abstract = {Phenotypic development is the result of a complex interplay involving the organism's own genetic make-up and the environment it experiences during development. The latter encompasses not just the current environment, but also indirect, and sometimes lagged, components that result from environmental effects on its parents that are transmitted to their developing offspring in various ways and at various stages. These environmental effects can simply constrain development, for example, where poor maternal condition gives rise to poorly provisioned, low-quality offspring. However, it is also possible that environmental circumstances during development shape the offspring phenotype in such a way as to better prepare it for the environmental conditions it is most likely to encounter during its life. Studying the extent to which direct and indirect developmental responses to environmental effects are adaptive requires clear elucidation of hypotheses and careful experimental manipulations. In this paper, I outline how the different paradigms applied in this field relate to each other, the main predictions that they produce and the kinds of experimental data needed to distinguish among competing hypotheses. I focus on birds in particular, but the theories discussed are not taxon specific. Environmental influences on phenotypic development are likely to be mediated, in part at least, by endocrine systems. I examine evidence from mechanistic and functional avian studies and highlight the general areas where we lack key information.},

However, our revisionary study have shown that the diversity of this taxon was underestimated as molecular and morphological data supported the recognition of C. milleri as a full species and revealed two previously unrecognized, small species of Cynomops. These newly recognized taxa are Cynomops freemani sp. nov. from the Canal Zone region, Panama, sister taxon to C. mexicanus, and Cynomops tonkigui sp. nov. from the eastern Andes of Ecuador and Colombia, sister taxon of C. milleri. We also describe the calls of Cynomops freemani sp. nov. that may be useful for the recognition of these species during field inventories based on ultrasonic recording techniques. We elevate the currently known diversity of Cynomops to eight species, as we also revalidate C. milleri providing an emended diagnosis and a redescription of this taxon.},

Most of the data was collected in the north portion of the country in full Sahelian zone. the major environments studied are described and he representative migratory elements of their avifauna indicated. Each species is the considered separately under several aspects: systematic, dates of presence, habitat, relative abundance and diet when known. The banding information has been included. The number of palearctic species wintering in S{\glq}n{\glq}gal is considerable: 150, or over a third of the total known avifauna of the region. It appears from this fact, that wintering in West Africa is qualitatively comparable to what is is in East Africa, regarded till now as a privileged zone....},

 abstract = {Modeling of neurodegenerative diseases in vitro holds great promise for biomedical research. Human cell lines harboring a mutations in disease-causing genes are thought to recapitulate early stages of the development an inherited disease. Modern genome-editing tools allow researchers to create isogenic cell clones with an identical genetic background providing an adequate {\dq}healthy{\dq} control for biomedical and pharmacological experiments. Here, we generated isogenic mutant cell clones with 150 CAG repeats in the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and performed ultrastructural and morphometric analyses of the internal organization of the mutant cells. Electron microscopy showed that deletion of three CAG triplets or an HTT gene knockout had no significant influence on the cell structure. The insertion of 150 CAG repeats led to substantial changes in quantitative and morphological parameters of mitochondria and increased the association of mitochondria with the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum while causing accumulation of small autolysosomes in the cytoplasm. Our data indicate for the first time that expansion of the CAG repeat tract in HTT introduced via the CRISPR/Cas9 technology into a human cell line initiates numerous ultrastructural defects that are typical for Huntington's disease.},

@article{Muheim.2016,
 abstract = {Magnetoreception of the light-dependent magnetic compass in birds is suggested to be mediated by a radical-pair mechanism taking place in the avian retina. Biophysical models on magnetic field effects on radical pairs generally assume that the light activating the magnetoreceptor molecules is nondirectional and unpolarized, and that light absorption is isotropic. However, natural skylight enters the avian retina unidirectionally, through the cornea and the lens, and is often partially polarized. In addition, cryptochromes, the putative magnetoreceptor molecules, absorb light anisotropically, i.e., they preferentially absorb light of a specific direction and polarization, implying that the light-dependent magnetic compass is intrinsically polarization sensitive. To test putative interactions between the avian magnetic compass and polarized light, we developed a spatial orientation assay and trained zebra finches to magnetic and/or overhead polarized light cues in a four-arm {\dq}plus{\dq} maze. The birds did not use overhead polarized light near the zenith for sky compass orientation. Instead, overhead polarized light modulated light-dependent magnetic compass orientation, i.e., how the birds perceive the magnetic field. Birds were well oriented when tested with the polarized light axis aligned parallel to the magnetic field. When the polarized light axis was aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, the birds became disoriented. These findings are the first behavioral evidence to our knowledge for a direct interaction between polarized light and the light-dependent magnetic compass in an animal. They reveal a fundamentally new property of the radical pair-based magnetoreceptor with key implications for how birds and other animals perceive the Earth's magnetic field.},

This places a premium on priorities: how can we support the most species at the least cost? One way is to identify 'biodiversity hotspots' where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44{\%} of all species of vascular plants and 35{\%} of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4{\%} of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a 'silver bullet' strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world's species at risk.},

@article{Nakagawa.2007,
 abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

We found that PC12 cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin exon 1 accumulated less mutant protein and showed decreased cell death when treated with clioquinol. This effect was polyglutamine-length-specific and did not alter mRNA levels or protein degradation rates. Clioquinol treatment of transgenic Huntington's mice (R6/2) improved behavioral and pathologic phenotypes, including decreased huntingtin aggregate accumulation, decreased striatal atrophy, improved rotarod performance, reduction of weight loss, normalization of blood glucose and insulin levels, and extension of lifespan. Our results suggest that clioquinol is a candidate therapy for Huntington's disease and other polyglutamine-expansion diseases.},

@article{Northrup.2018,
 abstract = {Understanding patterns of species occurrence and the processes underlying these patterns is fundamental to the study of ecology. One of the more commonly used approaches to investigate species occurrence patterns is occupancy modeling, which can account for imperfect detection of a species during surveys. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Bayesian modeling in ecology, which includes fitting Bayesian occupancy models. The Bayesian framework is appealing to ecologists for many reasons, including the ability to incorporate prior information through the specification of prior distributions on parameters. While ecologists almost exclusively intend to choose priors so that they are {\dq}uninformative{\dq} or {\dq}vague{\dq}, such priors can easily be unintentionally highly informative. Here we report on how the specification of a {\dq}vague{\dq} normally distributed (i.e., Gaussian) prior on coefficients in Bayesian occupancy models can unintentionally influence parameter estimation. Using both simulated data and empirical examples, we illustrate how this issue likely compromises inference about species-habitat relationships. While the extent to which these informative priors influence inference depends on the data set, researchers fitting Bayesian occupancy models should conduct sensitivity analyses to ensure intended inference, or employ less commonly used priors that are less informative (e.g., logistic or t prior distributions). We provide suggestions for addressing this issue in occupancy studies, and an online tool for exploring this issue under different contexts.},

@article{Nzama.2010,
 abstract = {Many birds exhibit considerable phenotypic flexibility in metabolism to maintain thermoregulation or to conserve energy. This flexibility usually includes seasonal variation in metabolic rate. Seasonal changes in physiology and behavior of birds are considered to be a part of their adaptive strategy for survival and reproductive success. House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) are small passerines from Europe that have been successfully introduced to many parts of the world, and thus may be expected to exhibit high phenotypic flexibility in metabolic rate. Mass specific Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) were significantly higher in winter compared with summer, although there was no significant difference between body mass in summer and winter. A similar, narrow thermal neutral zone (25-28°C) was observed in both seasons. Winter elevation of metabolic rate in House Sparrows was presumably related to metabolic or morphological adjustments to meet the extra energy demands of cold winters. Overall, House Sparrows showed seasonal metabolic acclimatization similar to other temperate wintering passerines. The improved cold tolerance was associated with a significant increase in VO2 in winter relative to summer. In addition, some summer birds died at 5°C, whereas winter birds did not, further showing seasonal variation in cold tolerance. The increase in BMR of 120{\%} in winter, compared to summer, is by far the highest recorded seasonal change so far in birds.},

@article{Oka.1999,
 abstract = {Habitat selection by tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula), a diving duck which swallows benthic prey organisms, was studied during winter at two neighboring lagoons (Lakes Nakaumi and Shinji, Honshu, Japan) which differ strongly in their benthic fauna and in their diving duck densities. The ducks fed overwhelmingly on the dominant bivalve found in each of the two lagoons, the mussel Musculiste senbousie in L. Nakaumi and the clam Corbicula jeponica in L. Shinji. In general, however, the ducks probably preferred the mussels to the clams because of: (i)their high (2.9 times) calorific content for their weight; (ii) their high digestibility; (iii) their greater accessibility; and (iv) their shorter handling time. An average tufted duck (850 g) was estimated to require 1.3 kg of mussels or 3.8 kg of clams to meet their daily energy requirements. As a result, the two wintering populations were estimated to consume 4970 t mussels and 4770 t clams during a single wintering season, amounting to some 20{\%} of the standing clam crop, Throughout the winter the average gizzard weight (37 g), and gizzard-body mass ratio (4.2{\%}) of the Lake Nakaumi population were half those of the Lake Shinji population (73 g. 8.1{\%}, respectively), despite their significantly similar nutritive body condition ({\%} body lipid {\textgreater} 12{\%}). The need to maintain a specialized gizzard mass in order to be able to cope with the different prey species results in little opportunity for 'sampling' movements of birds between lakes/prey types and as a result two subpopulations of ducks are indicated to be segregated.},

 abstract = {Abstract We used mark--recapture estimation techniques and radiography to test hypotheses about 3 important aspects of recruitment in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Fort Collins, Colorado: adult breeding probabilities, litter size, and 1st-year survival of young. We marked 2,968 females with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags at multiple sites during 2001--2005 and based our assessments on direct recaptures (breeding probabilities) and passive detection with automated PIT tag readers (1st-year survival). We interpreted our data in relation to hypotheses regarding demographic influences of bat age, roost, and effects of years with unusual environmental conditions: extreme drought (2002) and arrival of a West Nile virus epizootic (2003). Conditional breeding probabilities at 6 roosts sampled in 2002--2005 were estimated as 0.64 (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI]  =  0.53--0.73) in 1-year-old females, but were consistently high (95{\%} CI  =  0.94--0.96) and did not vary by roost, year, or prior year breeding status in older adults. Mean litter size was 1.11 (95{\%} CI  =  1.05--1.17), based on examination of 112 pregnant females by radiography. Litter size was not higher in older or larger females and was similar to results of other studies in western North America despite wide variation in latitude. First-year survival was estimated as 0.67 (95{\%} CI  =  0.61--0.73) for weaned females at 5 maternity roosts over 5 consecutive years, was lower than adult survival (0.79; 95{\%} CI  =  0.77--0.81), and varied by roost. Based on model selection criteria, strong evidence exists for complex roost and year effects on 1st-year survival. First-year survival was lowest in bats born during the drought year. Juvenile females that did not return to roosts as 1-year-olds had lower body condition indices in late summer of their natal year than those known to survive.},

@article{OShea.2011,
 abstract = {Abstract We studied adult survival and population growth at multiple maternity colonies of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Fort Collins, Colorado. We investigated hypotheses about survival using information-theoretic methods and mark--recapture analyses based on passive detection of adult females tagged with passive integrated transponders. We constructed a 3-stage life-history matrix model to estimate population growth rate (\textgreek{l}) and assessed the relative importance of adult survival and other life-history parameters to population growth through elasticity and sensitivity analysis. Annual adult survival at 5 maternity colonies monitored from 2001 to 2005 was estimated at 0.79 (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI] = 0.77--0.82). Adult survival varied by year and roost, with low survival during an extreme drought year, a finding with negative implications for bat populations because of the likelihood of increasing drought in western North America due to global climate change. Adult survival during winter was higher than in summer, and mean life expectancies calculated from survival estimates were lower than maximum longevity records. We modeled adult survival with recruitment parameter estimates from the same population. The study population was growing (\textgreek{l} = 1.096; 95{\%} CI = 1.057--1.135). Adult survival was the most important demographic parameter for population growth. Growth clearly had the highest elasticity to adult survival, followed by juvenile survival and adult fecundity (approximately equivalent in rank). Elasticity was lowest for fecundity of yearlings. The relative importances of the various life-history parameters for population growth rate are similar to those of large mammals.},

 abstract = {Community ecology aims to understand what factors determine the assembly and dynamics of species assemblages at different spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

 abstract = {In long-lived animals, adult survival is among the most important determinants of population dynamics. Although it may show considerable variation both in time and among populations and sites, a single survival estimate per species is often used in comparative evolutionary studies or in conservation management to identify threatened populations. We estimated adult survival of the isabelline serotine bat Eptesicus isabellinus using capture--recapture data collected on six maternity colonies scattered over a large area (distance 8--103 km) during periods varying from 8 to 26 years. We modelled temporal and inter-colony variations as random effects in a Bayesian framework and estimated mean annual adult survival of females on two scales and a single survival value across all colonies. On a coarse scale, we grouped colonies according to two different habitat types and investigated the effect on survival. A difference in adult survival was detected between the two habitat types [posterior mean of annual survival probability 0.71; 95{\%} credible interval (CI) 0.51--0.86 vs. 0.60; 0.28--0.89], but it was not statistically supported. On a fine scale, survival of the six colonies ranged between 0.58 (95{\%} CI 0.23--0.92) and 0.81 (0.73--0.88), with variation between only two colonies being statistically supported. Overall survival was 0.72 (95{\%} CI 0.57--0.93) with important inter-colony variability (on a logit scale 0.98; 95{\%} CI 0.00--8.16). Survival varied temporally in a random fashion across colonies. Our results show that inference based solely on single colonies should be treated with caution and that a representative unbiased estimate of survival for any species should ideally be based on multiple populations.},

@article{Papadatou.2012,
 abstract = {For comparative demography studies, 2 prerequisites are usually needed: 1) using typical parameter values for species, 2) correctly accounting for the uncertainty in the species specific estimates. However, although within-species variability may be essential, it is typically not considered in analytical procedures, resulting in parameter estimates that may not be representative of the species. Further, data are analysed in 2 steps, first separately for each species, then estimates are compared among species. Accounting for the uncertainty in the species specific estimates is then difficult. Here we propose the application of multilevel Bayesian models on mark---recapture (MR) data for comparative studies on survival probabilities that solves these problems. Our models account for within-species variability in space and time in the form of random effects. Models reflecting different biological predictions related to the species' ecology and life-history traits may further be contrasted. To illustrate our approach, we used long-term data from 5 temperate tree-roosting bat species and compared their survival probabilities. Results suggest that species foraging in open space, high reproductive output and short longevity records have lower survival than species foraging at short distances, with low reproductive output and high longevity records. Multilevel models provided relatively precise estimates, away from the edges of the parameter space, even for species with low encounter rates and short study duration. This is particularly valuable for less studied taxa such as bats for which available data are often more sparse. Our approach can be easily extended to include additional groups or levels of interest and effects at the individual level (e.g. sex or age). Different hypotheses regarding differences or similarities in parameters among species can be tested through the application of different models. Overall, it offers a flexible tool to ecologists, and population and evolutionary biologists for comparative studies, explicitly accounting for multilevel structures often encountered in MR data.},

 abstract = {The social structure of three sympatric bat species occupying bat boxes in woodland in southern England was studied: Pipistrellus pipistrellus (pipistrelle), Plecotus auritus (brown long-eared bat) and Myotis nattereri (Natterer{\&}apos;s bat). Before parturition, P. pipistrellus populations were heavily skewed towards solitary males. After parturition, the sex ratio was closer to unity. Recaptures of marked bats suggested that after parturition a resident male population of P. pipistrellus is invaded by a transient female population. The sex ratios of populations of P. auritus and M. nattereri were very close to unity, both pre- and post-parturition. The numbers of recaptures of individual bats were similar for both sexes in P. auritus and slightly higher for females in M. nattereri. In the mating season (August-October), solitary male P. pipistrellus were found with small groups (1-9) of females. In contrast, in both P. auritus and M. nattereri, mixed sex groups were found pre- and post-parturition, and roosting groups in the mating season contained up to 20 females and up to 10 males. The stability of female groups in P. auritus appeared to be higher than M. nattereri and P. pipistrellus as known females were found together more frequently. These patterns are discussed with reference to the possible differences in foraging and social behaviour.},

 abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

The wind-direction and speed had a paramount influence on the volume of migration in both spring and qutumn. Temperature had no effect in autumn, and though there was more migration with warmer than cold weather in sring, theis need not have been due to the influence of temperature as such.

 abstract = {The Lithuanian bat fauna includes 14 species. Myotis daubentoni, Pipistrellus nathusii, Plecotus auritus and Eptesicus serotinus are the most abundant and widespread species, although recently P.~auritus has disappeared from some hibernacula. There are still abundant populations of Myotis nattereri, Myotis brandti and Barbastella barbastellus in hibernacula, while their status in summer is unknown. Myotis dasycneme is probably very rare and endangered. The status of Myotis mystacinus and Nyctalus leisleri is not clear, but they are most likely very rare because very few specimens have been found. So far little is known about status of Nyctalus noctula, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Eptesicus nilssoni and Vespertilio murinus because these species are common only during autumn bat migration along the Baltic Sea coast. Two other species, Myotis bechsteini and Rhinolophus hipposideros, have been rejected from the list of bats of Lithuania, because old references to records of these species were not reliable. From what is currently known it seems that: (i) the northern limits of distribution of B.~barbastellus and E.~serotinus reach the middle of Lithuania between 55°N and 56°N, which may also be the southern limit of abundance of E.~nilssoni; (ii) the wintering site with the largest numbers of bats in Lithuania is the vaults of Kaunas fortress, where every year eight species are found hibernating in numbers estimated as follows: M.~daubentoni 400--500, M.~nattereri 200--300, M.~brandti 80--100, B.barbastellus 200--300, P.~auritus 40--60, M.~dasycneme 15--20 and a few E.~serotinus and E.~nilssoni. In Lithuania nine bat species have been protected by law since 1991, as species included in the Red Data Book. Also 11 bat reserves have been designated in Kaunas fortress to protect the most important hibernation sites in Lithuania.},

@article{Pennycott.2010,
 abstract = {Salmonellosis was diagnosed in garden birds from 198 incidents in Scotland between September 1995 and August 2008. Salmonellosis was essentially a disease of finches in the north of Scotland, but in the south of Scotland it was also a problem in house sparrows. Almost all of the incidents were caused by Salmonella Typhimurium phage types 40 or 56/variant, but regional variation in phage types was observed. In the north of Scotland, one phage type (DT 40) predominated, but in the south of Scotland two phage types were commonly isolated (DTs 40 and 56/variant, with the latter the more common of the two phage types). This regional difference was statistically significant for salmonellosis in greenfinches, chaffinches and 'other garden birds', but not for house sparrows. Different temporal patterns for different species of bird and different phage types were also observed within regions. These findings suggest that the epidemiology of salmonellosis in garden birds varies depending on the phage type of Salmonella and the species of garden bird, with additional regional differences depending on the wild bird populations and the phage types of Salmonella in circulation. An awareness of these differences will help when formulating guidelines aimed at reducing the impact of salmonellosis in garden birds.},

This allohiemic behaviour of the sexes was related to winter temperature taken at six places in western Europe. In Teal, Pintail and Wigeon a more or less pronounced relationship between temperature and recovery place was found, but differences between sexes are not significantly increased in cold winters. This makes it unlikely that allohiemy is caused by a different reaction of males and  females to low temperatures.},

 abstract = {Studying the dispersal behaviour of small, volant, and nocturnal animals such as microchiropterans with direct methods (banding--recapture, telemetry) is a very difficult task. The development of easily scorable and highly variable genetic markers nowadays allows us to study some aspects of dispersal indirectly, using population genetics. Here, we applied this indirect methods to characterize male dispersal behaviour in a European bat species. The eight microsatellite loci analysed were highly variable in all the nursing colonies assessed (h = 0.63 to 0.93). Contrary to what we found in the mtDNA, an AMOVA and F-statistics showed that the overall European population structure of the noctule bat was very weak, indicating a high male dispersal rate. Nevertheless, the population was not totally panmictic (theta = 0.006, p {\textless} 0.001), and neither isolation by distance, nor influence of migration could account for this result. Rather, an analysis of pairwise theta-values showed that the population structure might be explained partly by a geographical barrier to gene flow (the Alps), and partly by the fact that there is some limit to the distance the males can disperse.},

Here we illustrate both points in a survey of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences used to study the population genetics of hibernating colonies of a migrating species, the noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula). Lacking samples from Scandinavian nursery colonies, we use a North European hibernacula to suggest that Scandinavian populations are isolated from Central and East European colonies. Then, we compare genetic diversities of nursery and hibernating colonies. We find a significantly higher haplotype diversity in hibernacula, confirming that they consist of individuals from different nursery colonies. Finally, we show that pairwise comparisons of the haplotype frequencies of nursery and hibernating colonies contain some information on the migration direction of the noctule bat.},

 abstract = {Cognitive disturbances often predate characteristic motor dysfunction in individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) and place an increasing burden on the HD patients and caregivers with the progression of the disorder. Therefore, application of maximally translational cognitive tests to animal models of HD is imperative for the development of treatments that could alleviate cognitive decline in human patients. Here, we examined the performance of the Q175 mouse knock-in model of HD in the touch screen version of the paired associates learning (PAL) task. We found that 10-11-month-old heterozygous Q175 mice had severely attenuated learning curve in the PAL task, which was conceptually similar to previously documented impaired performance of individuals with HD in the PAL task of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Besides high rate of errors in PAL task, Q175 mice exhibited considerably lower responding rate than age-matched wild-type (WT) animals. Our examination of effortful operant responding during fixed ratio (FR) and progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedules in a separate cohort of similar age confirmed slower and unselective performance of mutant animals, as observed during PAL task, but suggested that motivation to work for nutritional reward in the touch screen setting was similar in Q175 and WT mice. We also demonstrated that pronounced sensorimotor disturbances in Q175 mice can be detected at early touch screen testing stages, (e.g., during {\dq}Punish Incorrect{\dq} phase of operant pretraining), so we propose that shorter test routines may be utilised for more expedient studies of treatments aimed at the rescue of HD-related phenotype.},

 abstract = {Superoxide generation by mitochondria respiratory complexes is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are capable of initiating redox signalling and oxidative damage. Current understanding of the role of mitochondrial ROS in health and disease has been limited by the lack of experimental strategies to selectively induce mitochondrial superoxide production. The recently-developed mitochondria-targeted redox cycler MitoParaquat (MitoPQ) overcomes this limitation, and has proven effective in vitro and in Drosophila. Here we present an in vivo study of MitoPQ in the vertebrate zebrafish model in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), and in a human cell model of Huntington's disease (HD). We show that MitoPQ is 100-fold more potent than non-targeted paraquat in both cells and in zebrafish in vivo. Treatment with MitoPQ induced a parkinsonian phenotype in zebrafish larvae, with decreased sensorimotor reflexes, spontaneous movement and brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, without detectable effects on heart rate or atrioventricular coordination. Motor phenotypes and TH levels were partly rescued with antioxidant or monoaminergic potentiation strategies. In a HD cell model, MitoPQ promoted mutant huntingtin aggregation without increasing cell death, contrasting with the complex I inhibitor rotenone that increased death in cells expressing either wild-type or mutant huntingtin. These results show that MitoPQ is a valuable tool for cellular and in vivo studies of the role of mitochondrial superoxide generation in redox biology, and as a trigger or co-stressor to model metabolic and neurodegenerative disease phenotypes.},

@article{Pipoly.2013,
 abstract = {The frequency of extreme meteorological events such as heat waves and rainstorms is predicted to increase with climate change. However, there is still little information about how extreme weather influences reproduction in animals. It may not only affect breeding success but might also alter offspring sex ratio if males and females are differentially sensitive to meteorological conditions during development. We investigated the relationship between meteorological conditions and reproductive success over 6 years in a house sparrow population in central Europe. We found that hatching success increased with the number of extremely hot days (daily maximum {\textgreater}31°C) and decreased with the number of extremely cold days ({\textless}16°C) during incubation, although the latter effect held only for clutches with relatively short incubation periods. Fledging success was unrelated to weather variables. However, the frequency of extremely hot days had a negative effect on fledglings' body mass and tarsus length, although both of these traits were positively related to average temperature. Additionally, fledglings' body mass increased with the length of period without rainfall before fledging. Male to female ratio among fledglings did not differ from 1:1 and did not vary with weather variables. The magnitude of the effects of extreme meteorological events was usually small, although in some cases comparable to those of ecologically relevant predictors of reproductive success. Our results indicate that meteorological conditions have complex effects on breeding success, as the effects of extreme weather can differ between different aspects of reproduction and also from the effects of overall meteorological conditions.},

@article{Poulsen.2011,
 abstract = {In tropical forests, hunting nearly always accompanies logging. The entangled

nature of these disturbances complicates our ability to resolve applied questions, such as

whether secondary and degraded forest can sustain populations of tropical animals. With the

expansion of logging in central Africa, conservation depends on knowledge of the individual

and combined impacts of logging and hunting on animal populations. Our goals were (1) to

decouple the effects of selective logging and hunting on densities of animal guilds, including

apes, duikers, monkeys, elephant, pigs, squirrels, and large frugivorous and insectivorous birds

and (2) to compare the relative importance of these disturbances to the effects of local-scale

variation in forest structure and fruit abundance. In northern Republic of Congo, we surveyed

animals along 30 transects positioned in forest disturbed by logging and hunting, logging

alone, and neither logging nor hunting. While sampling transects twice per month for two

years, we observed 47 179 animals of 19 species and eight guilds in 1154 passages (2861 km).

Species densities varied by as much as 480{\%} among forest areas perturbed by logging and/or

hunting, demonstrating the strong effects of these disturbances on populations of some

species. Densities of animal guilds varied more strongly with disturbance type than with

variation in forest structure, canopy cover, and fruit abundance. Independently, logging and

hunting decreased density of some guilds and increased density of others: densities varied from

44{\%} lower (pigs) to 90{\%} higher (insectivorous birds) between logged and unlogged forest and

from 61{\%} lower (apes) to 77{\%} higher (frugivorous birds) between hunted and unhunted forest.

Their combined impacts exacerbated decreases in populations of some guilds (ape, duiker,

monkey, and pig), but counteracted one another for others (squirrels, insectivorous and

frugivorous birds). Together, logging and hunting shifted the relative abundance of the animal

community away from large mammals toward squirrels and birds. Logged forest, even in the

absence of hunting, does not maintain similar densities as unlogged forest for most animal

guilds. To balance conservation with the need for economic development and wild meat in

tropical countries, landscapes should be spatially managed to include protected areas,

community hunting zones, and production fores},

@article{Powell.2000,
 abstract = {Biologists often estimate separate survival and movement rates from radiotelemetry and mark-recapture data from the same study population. We describe a method for combining these data types in a single model to obtain joint, potentially less biased estimates of survival and movement that use all available data. We furnish an example using wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) captured at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in central Georgia in 1996. The model structure allows estimation of survival and capture probabilities, as well as estimation of movements away from and into the study area. In addition, the model structure provides many possibilities for hypothesis testing. Using the combined model structure, we estimated that weekly survival of wood thrushes was 0.989 $\pm$ 0.007 ($\pm$SE). Survival rates of banded and radiomarked individuals were not different ( {\$}\hat{\alpha}[S{\_}{radioed},S{\_}{banded}]=\text{log}[\hat{S}{\_}{radioed}/\hat{S}{\_}{banded}]{\$} = 0.0239, 95{\%} CI = -0.0196 to 0.0486). Fidelity rates (weekly probability of remaining in a stratum) did not differ between geographic strata ( {\$}\hat{\Psi}=0.911$\backslash$pm 0.020{\$} ; {\$}\hat{\alpha}[$\backslash$Psi {\^{}}{11},$\backslash$Psi {\^{}}{22}]{\$} = 0.0161, 95{\%} CI = -0.0309 to 0.0631), and recapture rates (p = 0.097 $\pm$ 0.016) of banded and radiomarked individuals were not different ( {\$}\hat{\alpha}[p{\_}{radioed},p{\_}{banded}]{\$} = 0.145, 95{\%} CI = -0.510 to 0.800). Combining these data types in a common model resulted in more precise estimates of movement and recapture rates than separate estimation, but ability to detect stratum or mark-specific differences in parameters was weak. We conducted simulation trials to investigate the effects of varying study designs on parameter accuracy and statistical power to detect important differences. Parameter accuracy was high (relative bias [RBIAS] {\textless}2{\%}) and confidence interval coverage close to nominal, except for survival estimates of banded birds for the {\dq}off study area{\dq} stratum, which were negatively biased (RBIAS -7 to -15{\%}) when sample sizes were small (5-10 banded or radioed animals {\dq}released{\dq} per time interval). To provide adequate data for useful inference from this model, study designs should seek a minimum of 25 animals of each marking type observed (marked or observed via telemetry) in each time period and geographic stratum.},

 abstract = {The swiftlets (genera Aerodramus, Collocalia and Hydrochous) are unusual among birds in that many species can orientate in complete darkness using echolocation. The position of the Papuan Swiftlet Aerodramus papuensis in this group has been uncertain historically, in part due to morphological differences between it and other swiftlets (it has three toes instead of the usual four) and a lack of data on its behaviour (there is uncertainty about whether it echolocates). Here we investigate the phylogenetic affinities of the Papuan Swiftlet using DNA sequence data from two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and ND2. We present evidence that it is able to echolocate but, unlike previously studied species that use echolocation primarily while flying in caves, A. papuensis uses this ability while active outside caves at night. We also provide new evidence for placement of the monotypic Waterfall Swiftlet Hydrochous gigas, a species that does not echolocate. Our data provide strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and H. gigas are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus. Our phylogeny provides new insights into how echolocation has evolved in the swiftlets, in particular by indicating higher levels of homoplasy in this trait than was previously thought.},

@article{Quillfeldt.2011,
 abstract = {Sex differences in foraging behaviour have been explained by size dimorphism and/or

avoidance of inter-sexual competition for depletable resources. To distinguish between these 2

hypotheses, we examined how intrinsic factors (sex-related differences) and extrinsic factors (year

differences) shape the foraging behaviour of size-dimorphic imperial shags Phalacrocorax atriceps

albiventer breeding at New Island, Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas. We deployed time-depth and

compass loggers to male and female imperial shags over 3 consecutive chick-feeding seasons. Males

and females partly overlapped in coastal foraging areas, which were used mainly for benthic diving.

Males additionally used offshore areas over deep water for shallow pelagic diving, suggesting that

spatial segregation is involved in the avoidance of inter-sexual competition for food. Stable isotope

data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic

levels in males, as expected for their larger size. Males were 27{\%} heavier than females and reached

greater maximum dive depths (98.9 $\pm$ 5.3 m) than females (54.1 $\pm$ 2.9 m). However, contrary to predictions

based on body size dimorphism, the median dive depths of males were similar to those of

females. While females used mainly benthic diving, males were more flexible in their benthic and

pelagic foraging behaviour. Females also carried out more dives per day in all years, and deeper and

longer dives than males in one year. As dive parameters differed strongly among the years, our

results suggest that body size dimorphism and the avoidance of inter-sexual competition for food are

involved in the evolution of sex-related differences in foraging in this species.},

@article{Rehnus.2018,
 abstract = {Alpine and Arctic species are considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, which is expected to cause habitat loss, fragmentation and-ultimately-extinction of cold-adapted species. However, the impact of climate change on glacial relict populations is not well understood, and specific recommendations for adaptive conservation management are lacking. We focused on the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) as a model species and modelled species distribution in combination with patch and landscape-based connectivity metrics. They were derived from graph-theory models to quantify changes in species distribution and to estimate the current and future importance of habitat patches for overall population connectivity. Models were calibrated based on 1,046 locations of species presence distributed across three biogeographic regions in the Swiss Alps and extrapolated according to two IPCC scenarios of climate change (RCP 4.5 {\&} 8.5), each represented by three downscaled global climate models. The models predicted an average habitat loss of 35{\%} (22{\%}-55{\%}) by 2100, mainly due to an increase in temperature during the reproductive season. An increase in habitat fragmentation was reflected in a 43{\%} decrease in patch size, a 17{\%} increase in the number of habitat patches and a 34{\%} increase in inter-patch distance. However, the predicted changes in habitat availability and connectivity varied considerably between biogeographic regions: Whereas the greatest habitat losses with an increase in inter-patch distance were predicted at the southern and northern edges of the species' Alpine distribution, the greatest increase in patch number and decrease in patch size is expected in the central Swiss Alps. Finally, both the number of isolated habitat patches and the number of patches crucial for maintaining the habitat network increased under the different variants of climate change. Focusing conservation action on the central Swiss Alps may help mitigate the predicted effects of climate change on population connectivity.},

@article{Rice.2010,
 abstract = {Unlike other North American prairie-nesting dabbling ducks, northern pintail (Anas acuta) populations have not increased since the early 1990s and remain well below the long-term average for traditional survey areas. Previously reported estimates of annual survival and recovery rates for pintails did not investigate any spatial or temporal factors to explain annual variation of these rates. We used band-recovery data from 1970 to 2003 to test the influence of temporal periods defined by differing harvest regulations and habitat conditions of breeding grounds with spatially delineated regions on survival and recovery rates of northern pintails in North America. We separated regions based on a multiresponse permutation procedure to identify banding blocks with dissimilar recovery distributions based on a cluster analysis. We categorized time by grouping years into temporal periods based on bag limits, season lengths, or overflight versus nonoverflight years. We used the Brownie approach in Program MARK to evaluate 46 a priori models estimating survival and recovery rates. The best approximating model indicated that survival varied with age, sex, and region with additive time and interactive time-by-age and time-by-region effects. Recovery rate was best represented by a fully interactive term comprised of age, sex, region, and year. There were no statistical differences among average annual survival point estimates between age and sex classes within each region, and our estimates were similar to previous unpublished studies. We found the eastern region had decreased survival and increased recovery rates compared to other regions. Trends in pintail survival suggest that variation in annual survival was not the cause of the initial decrease in the northern pintail population and is unlikely the dominant factor preventing the population from increasing. The influence of other population parameters, such as recruitment rate, should be investigated to further evaluate other causes for the population status of northern pintails. Use of the top-ranked model to estimate annual survival and recovery rates for northern pintails in North America, which indicated that annually varying estimates of survival rates were better supported by the data than grouping years into temporal classes (i.e., based on bag limits, season lengths, and overflight yr) can be used by managers and policy makers when considering annual harvest regulations and effects of conservation efforts. Managers should incorporate these estimates into future demographic studies of pintails as well as consider using the top-ranked model for future analyses of band-recovery data.},

@article{Ricklefs.1984,
 abstract = {I have developed models relating the rate of growth of altricial birds to annual production of fledglings, a measure of evolutionary fitness. In the models, growth rate influences production through its effects on the power requirements of the nestling and the length of the nesting cycle; the latter in turn affects probability of survival to fledging and number of broods reared per year. The models were evaluated to determine whether empirically reasonable estimates of power requirements and nesting mortality resulted in predicted optimum growth rates within the range of observed values. By and large the models were successful. They do not adequately explain the reduced growth rates of tropical altricial species compared to their temperate-zone counterparts. Moreover, they do not address the phenomenon of slow growth in self-feeding, precocial species. But the confirmation of the model for many altricial birds suggests that it may be possible to understand interspecific variation in growth rates as the result of adaptations to levels of predation and the requirement for, and availability of, energy to the nestling.},

@article{Rivers.2006,
 abstract = {Many species of temperate bats visit underground sites in autumn, prior to hibernation, and chase each other in and around the entrances in an event known as autumn swarming. It has been suggested that swarming is a mating event that facilitates gene flow between bats from otherwise isolated summer colonies. We describe swarming behaviour at a cluster of four caves in the North of England and provide direct evidence for seasonal migration of Natterer's bats (Myotis nattereri ) between these caves and many summer nursery roosts in a catchment area of at least 60 km radius. Mark-recapture analysis suggests that an estimated 2000--6000 Natterer's bats use the three best-studied caves, together with smaller numbers of four other species: M. daubentonii, M. brandtii, M. mystacinus and Plecotus auritus. Recaptures also show that there is a small interchange of bats between these three caves, which are 0.6--1.5 km apart. Capture rates, automatic logging and video recordings at one cave suggest that an average 310--400 bats visit the cave each night. Mating at swarming sites would be particularly important for gene flow if a species showed no other dispersal pattern. We provide evidence for natal philopatry, with little or no dispersal, in both sexes of Natterer's bats. The protection of swarming sites is discussed in light of our findings.},

@article{Roche.2011,
 abstract = {A robust and cost-efficient method for monitoring some of Ireland's more common bat species was devised in 2003 and has been carried out yearly since then. The objective of the scheme is to provide information on bat population trends and distributions in Ireland. Night-time surveys are conducted in July and August, whereby bat vocalizations are recorded from a time expansion bat detector to a minidisc while driving a known route by car at a constant driving speed. Bat vocalizations are subsequently analysed using sound analysis software. In Ireland, the roadside populations of three target species, the common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle and Leisler's bat, can be monitored effectively using this car-based method of survey. Power statistics indicate that a decline of high conservation priority of the least frequently encountered species of the three, Leisler's bat, could be detected within 12~years of monitoring if 25, 30 $\times$ 30~km survey squares, each with fifteen 1.6~km transects, are surveyed twice annually. The scheme has revealed new data on the relative bat activity distributions across the island of Ireland. Common pipistrelles are more frequent in the south of the country and Leisler's bats are more frequent in the south and east. Analysis of yearly count data indicated an initially increasing trend in the common pipistrelle and Leisler's bat for the first 4~years of the survey, followed by more recent declines. Ireland has a relatively depauperate bat fauna; hence, a potentially greater number of microchiropteran species could be monitored in other regions using this method. The protocol is easily repeatable and does not have to be carried out by bat specialists. In Ireland, it takes c. 300~h of volunteer time annually to carry out this statistically robust monitoring scheme for all three bat species.},

@article{Roscioni.2014,
 abstract = {Little is known about the potentially disrupting effects of wind farms on the habitat connectivity of flying vertebrates at the landscape scale. We developed a regional-scale model to assess the wind farm impact on bat migration and commuting routes. The model was implemented for the bat Nyctalus leisleri in a region of central Italy currently undergoing considerable wind farm development. A Species Distribution Model (SDM) for N. leisleri was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm based on 47 presence records (reduced to 19 after the autocorrelation procedure) and 10 environmental variables derived from topographic and land cover maps. We used the SDM to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The SDM was statistically robust (AUC {\textgreater} 0.8). Most of the corridors were concentrated in the western part of the region, which hosts the largest suitable areas for the species; most of the existing (54 {\%}) and planned (72 {\%}) wind farms interfered with important corridors connecting the western and the eastern parts of the region. Our results provide key information on the impact of the wind farm industry on biodiversity on a regional scale. The novel approach adopted, based on SDM and connectivity analysis, could be easily extended to other flying vertebrates and landscapes and constitutes a promising planning tool necessary for harmonizing the development of renewable energy infrastructures with issues of biodiversity conservation.},

The bats were counted and dead bats collected at 1-month intervals from October to April. In total, thirty four dead bats were found. The percentage of dead individuals of the surveyed bats was low:Myotis daubentonii (0.6{\%}),M. nattereri (0.4{\%}),Plecotus auritus (0.4{\%}),M. myotis (0.1{\%}), and zero forBarbastella barbastellus. There was no clear difference in the species ratio of the observed and dead bats. The percentage of the dead to surveyed bats was lower in November (0.07{\%}) and December (0.07{\%}), and higher in September (3.3{\%}) and April (1.3{\%}). Temperature explained 84{\%} of variation of the differences in mortality rates. Observations suggest that non-predator and non-accidental mortality inside the fortifications was extremely low and non-linearly correlated with the ambient temperature measured outside the fortifications.},

@article{Rushing.2017,
 abstract = {Determining the geographic connections between breeding and nonbreeding populations, termed migratory connectivity, is critical to advancing our understanding of the ecology and conservation of migratory species. Assignment models based on stable isotopes historically have been an important tool for studying migratory connectivity of small-bodied species, but the low resolution of these assignments has generated interest into combining isotopes with other sources in information. Abundance is one of the most appealing data sources to include in isotope-based assignments, but there are currently no statistical methods or guidelines for optimizing the contribution of stable isotopes and abundance for inferring migratory connectivity. Using known-origin stable-hydrogen isotope samples of six Neotropical migratory bird species, we rigorously assessed the performance of assignment models that differentially weight the contribution of the isotope and abundance data. For two species with adequate sample sizes, we used Pareto optimality to determine the set of models that simultaneously minimized both assignment error rate and assignment area. We then assessed the ability of the top models from these two species to improve assignments of the remaining four species compared to assignments based on isotopes alone. We show that the increased precision of models that include abundance is often offset by a large increase in assignment error. However, models that optimally weigh the abundance data relative to the isotope data can result in higher precision and, in some cases, lower error than models based on isotopes alone. The top models, however, depended on the distribution of relative breeding abundance, with patchier distributions requiring stronger downweighting of abundance, and we present general guidelines for future studies. These results confirm that breeding abundance can be an important source of information for studies investigating broad-scale movements of migratory birds and potentially other taxa.},

@article{Safi.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Understanding how environmental conditions, especially wind, influence birds' flight speeds is a prerequisite for understanding many important aspects of bird flight, including optimal migration strategies, navigation, and compensation for wind drift. Recent developments in tracking technology and the increased availability of data on large-scale weather patterns have made it possible to use path annotation to link the location of animals to environmental conditions such as wind speed and direction. However, there are various measures available for describing not only wind conditions but also the bird's flight direction and ground speed, and it is unclear which is best for determining the amount of wind support (the length of the wind vector in a bird's flight direction) and the influence of cross-winds (the length of the wind vector perpendicular to a bird's direction) throughout a bird's journey.

RESULTS

We compared relationships between cross-wind, wind support and bird movements, using path annotation derived from two different global weather reanalysis datasets and three different measures of direction and speed calculation for 288 individuals of nine bird species. Wind was a strong predictor of bird ground speed, explaining 10-66{\%} of the variance, depending on species. Models using data from different weather sources gave qualitatively similar results; however, determining flight direction and speed from successive locations, even at short (15 min intervals), was inferior to using instantaneous GPS-based measures of speed and direction. Use of successive location data significantly underestimated the birds' ground and airspeed, and also resulted in mistaken associations between cross-winds, wind support, and their interactive effects, in relation to the birds' onward flight.

CONCLUSIONS

Wind has strong effects on bird flight, and combining GPS technology with path annotation of weather variables allows us to quantify these effects for understanding flight behaviour. The potentially strong influence of scaling effects must be considered and implemented in developing sampling regimes and data analysis.},

@article{Saino.2017c,
 abstract = {Life of many organisms flows as a sequence of annual cycles. Timing of cyclical events is shaped by natural selection also via the domino effects that any life history stage has on the stages that follow. Such 'carry-over effects' have major consequences for evolutionary, ecological and demographic processes, but the causes that generate their individual-level variation, including the effect of sex, are poorly understood. We used light-level geolocators to study carry-over effects on the year-round life cycle of the long-distance migratory barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) and sex-dependent variation in their strength. Correlation analyses showed that timing of breeding influenced departure time for autumn migration in females but not in males. In addition, strong, time-mediated carry-over effects of timing of departure from the wintering areas in sub-Saharan Africa for spring migration on timing of arrival to the breeding grounds in Italy and Switzerland operated in both sexes. However, carry-over effects of spring migration phenology on breeding date and seasonal fecundity were observed among females but not among males. We used partial least squares path modelling to unveil the complex carry-over effects of phenology during the non-breeding season in combination with the ecological conditions experienced by individual swallows in the wintering area, as gauged by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values (NDVI), on breeding performance. Phenology during the non-breeding season combined with NDVI during wintering accounted for as much as 65-70{\%} of variation in subsequent seasonal fecundity in females, while such carry-over effects on breeding success of males were weaker. Intense, sex-specific carry-over effects can have impacted on evolutionary processes, including sexual selection, and affected phenological response to climate change, causing the large population decline observed in this species.},

 abstract = {Urban environments pose novel challenges, as well as opportunities, for urban-dwelling wildlife. Although differences have been reported in several phenotypic traits (e.g. morphology, physiology and behaviour) between urban and rural populations, it is poorly understood whether this affects individual fitness. Telomere dynamics are posited as one possible mechanism underlying senescence and mortality. It was recently shown that telomere shortening is accelerated when growing up in an urban, compared with a rural, environment. However, the implications of accelerated telomere attrition for fitness are still unclear. Here, we examine the relationship between telomere length (TL) and survival in a bird common to urban and rural environments, and during both early and later life. The results reveal that TL is a strong predictor of post-fledging survival and recruitment in both habitats but, crucially, selective disappearance of individuals with short telomeres early in life is more pronounced in the urban environment, resulting in a longer average TL among the adult population. However, following recruitment, we found no difference in the relationship between TL and survival between the urban and rural environments. This indicates that the urban environment has negative effects in early life, while during later life the benefits could potentially outweigh the costs.},

 abstract = {Organisms living in arctic and alpine environments are increasingly impacted by human activities. To evaluate the potential impacts of global change, a better understanding of the demography of organisms in extreme environments is needed. In this study, we compare the age-specific demography of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) breeding at arctic and subalpine sites, and white-tailed ptarmigan (L. leucurus) breeding at an alpine site. Rates of egg production improved with age at the alpine and subalpine sites, but the stochastic effects of nest and brood predation led to similar rates of annual fecundity among 1-, 2-, and 3+-year-old females. All populations had short generation times (T{\textless}2.7 years) and low net reproductive rates (R0{\textless}1.2). Stable age distributions were weighted towards 1-year-old females in willow ptarmigan ({\textgreater}59{\%}), and to 3+-year-old females in white-tailed ptarmigan ({\textgreater}47{\%}). High damping ratios (rho{\textgreater}3.2) indicated that asymptotic estimates were likely to match natural age distributions. Sensitivity and elasticity values indicated that changes in juvenile survival would have the greatest impact on the finite rate of population change (lambda) in willow ptarmigan, whereas changes to the survival of 3+-year-old females would have a greater effect in white-tailed ptarmigan. High survivorship buffers white-tailed ptarmigan in alpine environments against the potential effects of climate change on annual fecundity, but may make the species more sensitive to the effects of pollutants or harvesting on adult survival. Conversely, processes that reduce annual fecundity would have a greater impact on the population viability of willow ptarmigan in arctic and subalpine environments. If these same demographic patterns prove to be widespread among organisms in extreme environments, it may be possible to develop general recommendations for conservation of the biological resources of arctic and alpine ecosystems.},

@article{Sanders.2012,
 abstract = {Federal migratory bird bands have been inscribed with a postal address and toll-free telephone number (toll-free bands) since 1995 for their reporting, but in 2007 the postal mail address was replaced with an internet address (web-address bands). The reporting rate of web-address bands is unknown, and knowledge of band reporting probabilities is an integral part of bird band-recovery studies designed to obtain unbiased estimates of harvest rates and recovery rates if use of band types differs across space and time. We estimated web-address band reporting probabilities for mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) in the United States by comparing the relative recovery rate (ratio) of web-address to toll-free bands and applying this as an adjustment factor to the known reporting probabilities of toll-free bands. Cooperators banded 132,386 doves representing 57,982 (44{\%}) web-address and 74,404 (56{\%}) toll-free bands in July and August during 2008--2010 across 34 states, 12 regions, and 3 management units. Of the birds banded, 4,642 (3.5{\%}) were direct recoveries, as a result of being shot, and all but 3 were reported via telephone or internet. Nationally, internet reporting accounted for 16.3{\%} of toll-free bands and 42.9{\%} of web-address bands recovered. Web-address bands had a greater recovery rate than toll-free bands (ratio = 1.081, SE = 0.027). We found some evidence of spatial variation in ratio estimates at management unit and regional scales, but the variation was primarily at the regional level where it was not great (range = 1.015--1.213) and statistical support for this variation was not particularly strong (SE = 0.129). Nationally, the web-address band reporting probability was 0.535 (SE = 0.021), an absolute increase of 0.040 compared to the reporting probability of toll-free bands. The additional reporting probability of web-address bands relative to toll-free bands must be accounted for in band-recovery studies used to obtain estimates of harvest rates and recovery rates if use of band types differs across space and time for mourning doves and possibly other species.},

@article{Santos.2013,
 abstract = {Bats are often killed in large numbers at wind farms over a wide geographical range. We aimed to predict which areas conferred higher fatality risks to bats at wind farms. In an innovative approach, we combined species distribution modelling with mortality data and the ecological conditions at wind farms located in Portugal. We then generated predictive models to determine areas of probable mortality and which environmental factors were promoting it. Mortality data for four bat species, Hypsugo savii, Nyctalus leisleri, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, were used. These experienced the highest levels of fatalities at wind farms in Portugal, comprising 290 of the 466 fatalities recorded from 2003 to 2011.


The mortality risk models showed robust performances. Wind farms sited at humid areas with mild temperatures, closer than 5 km to forested areas and within 600 m of steep slopes showed higher probabilities of mortality. High mortality risk areas also overlapped highly with the potential distribution of N. leisleri in Portugal, suggesting that populations of this species may be at high risk due to wind farm fatalities. Moreover, a large extent of the area predicted to be a hotspot for mortality (i.e. areas likely to confer high mortality risk for four species) overlaps with sites highly suitable for wind farm construction.


In summary, the approach used in this study could be paradigmatic for the development of important pre-emptive conservation measures for bat populations by identifying mortality risk in areas prior to wind farm installation and determining which conditions promote mortality.},

@article{Scheepens.2013,
 abstract = {In many biomes, global warming has resulted in advanced and longer growing seasons, which has often led to earlier flowering in plant taxa. Elevational gradients are ideal to study the effects of global warming as they allow transplantation of plants from their original cooler higher elevations down to elevations with a prospective climate. We transplanted plants from ten populations of the European alpine monocarpic herb species Campanula thyrsoides L. to three sites along a steep mountain slope (600, 1,235 and 1,850 m above sea level) in the Swiss Alps and asked whether reproductive phenology adjusts plastically to elevation and if these responses were adaptive, i.e. increased the fitness of plants. We further assessed current genetic differentiation in phenotypic traits and whether any such origin effects were due to adaptation to climatic conditions of origin. Our results showed that transplantation to lower elevations caused strong shifts in phenology, with plants starting growth and flowering earlier than plants placed at higher elevations. However, compared to flower production at high elevation, number of flowers per plant decreased 21 {\%} at mid- and 61 {\%} at low elevation. The shift in phenology thus came with a high cost in fitness, and we suggest that phenology is maladaptive when C. thyrsoides faces temperature conditions deviating from its natural amplitude. We conclude that the frequently reported phenological shift in plant species as a response to global warming may include heavy fitness costs that may hamper species survival.},

@article{Schmaljohann.2007,
 abstract = {Billions of songbirds breeding in the Western Palaearctic cross the largest desert of the world, the Sahara, twice a year. While crossing Europe, the vast majority use an intermittent flight strategy, i.e. fly at night and rest or feed during the day. However, it was long assumed that they overcome the Sahara in a 40 h non-stop flight. In this study, we observed bird migration with radar in the plain sand desert of the Western Sahara (Mauritania) during autumn and spring migration and revealed a clear prevalence of intermittent migration. Massive departures of songbirds just after sunset independent of site and season suggests strongly that songbirds spent the day in the plain desert. Thus, most songbirds cross the Sahara predominantely by the intermittent flight strategy. Autumn migration took place mainly at low altitudes with high temperatures, its density decreased abruptly before sunrise, followed by very little daytime migration. Migration was highly restricted to night-time and matched perfectly the intermittent flight strategy. However, in spring, when migratory flights occurred at much higher altitudes than in autumn, in cool air, about 17{\%} of the songbird migration occurred during the day. This suggests that flying in high temperatures and turbulent air, as is the case in autumn, may lead to an increase in water and/or energy loss and may prevent songbirds from prolonged flights into the day.},

@article{Schmidt.2008,
 abstract = {In sexually selected signals, distinct components often have specific signal value in mate choice or malemale competition. In

songbirds, structural song traits such as trills, that is, a series of repetitive notes, can be important in female choice. However, little

is known about their signal value in malemale interactions. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that males assess the competitive

abilities of rivals based on the use and performance of rapid broadband trills produced within songs. Using a 2-speaker

playback experiment, we exposed territorial male nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, that differed in their subsequent pairing

success, to a simulated vocal interaction between 2 unfamiliar rivals. The singing of the 2 simulated rivals differed in the number

of songs containing rapid broadband trills. Subjects responded significantly more strongly to the loudspeaker that broadcast

songs containing such trills than to the loudspeaker that broadcast exclusively songs without such trills. Moreover, responses also

depended on the fine structure of trills. Males that became paired later in the season significantly increased their response

intensity with increasing trill performance, whereas males that remained unpaired responded in the opposite way and decreased

their response intensity with increasing trill performance. These results indicate that rapid broadband trills are a signal of

aggression and that the nature of the response in vocal interactions reflects aspects of the challenged maleﾒs fitness.},

@article{Seifert.2018,
 abstract = {Knowledge on whereabouts within the annual cycle of migratory species is prerequisite for many aspects in ecology and biological conservation. Spatial assignments of stable isotopes archived in tissues allows for later inference on sites where the specific tissue had been grown. It has been rarely tested whether spatial assignments match directly tracked non-breeding residences, especially for migratory songbirds. We here compare assignments of stable isotopes from feathers of Palaearctic Barn swallows Hirundo rustica with their African non-breeding residence sites tracked by geolocation.Assignments based on \textgreek{d}2H, \textgreek{d}13C and \textgreek{d}15N isotope compositions delineate three main non-breeding regions: a main cluster in central Africa, a second in West Africa, and the third cluster in Northern Africa. Using \textgreek{d}13C, \textgreek{d}15N only, non-breeding sites ranged from clusters in West/Southwest Africa to South East Africa with a centre in Central Africa. The non-breeding areas (50{\%} and 75{\%} Kernel density estimates, KDE) of the birds tracked by geolocation stretched from West Africa via central Africa to southern Africa. We found little overlap of 0.3{\%} (assuming a 1:1 odds ratio) to 1.4{\%} (3:1 odds ratio) in the three element assignments and KDEs for only 2 and 13 individuals out of 32 birds. Assignment maps for two elements (\textgreek{d}13C, \textgreek{d}15N) and KDEs showed higher consistencies with an overlap of 3.6 and 8.5{\%} for 12 and 18 birds. We argue that the low matching between stable isotope assignments and non-breeding sites in our study arise from insufficient baseline data for Africa (concerning both isoscapes and specific discrimination functions). However, other factors like aerial foraging habit of the species, and a potential mismatch of non-breeding site location and the spatial origin of aerial plankton might further hamper accurate assignments. Finally we call for concerted analyses of tissues i.e. feathers and claws of birds which are grown at known sites across the continent and from species with various ecological requirements (diverse habitats, foraging behaviours, and diet compositions) to establish isoscapes for general applicability.},

@article{Sendor.2003,
 abstract = {* 1Life-history theory assumes increased mortality at certain stages such as hibernation. However, seasonal variation of survival rates of hibernating mammals has rarely been estimated. In this study, apparent survival of pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) hibernating and performing summer swarming at a large hibernaculum (Marburg Castle, Hesse, Germany), was modelled using seasonal (summer/winter) capture--recapture data for the years 1996--2000. The spring survival interval includes the period of arousal at the end of hibernation and therefore validly measures survival associated with hibernation.

* 2In five summers and four winters, 15~839 bats were captured and released (13~082 individuals) and 3403 recaptures recorded. Analysis was complicated by transience and trap-dependence. Recapture rates varied seasonally and by group. The autumnal survival estimates were negatively biased due to transience effects that could not be taken into account.

* 3Survival could be modelled using two age-classes, with reduced first-year juvenile survival. The age effect persisted over the first autumn and spring. There was virtually no evidence for sex-specific survival rates; male and female survival were found to be almost equal. In the best-fitting models, survival rates varied over time and differed among sexes and age-classes by a constant amount. Between years, there was only a small variation in spring survival, which could not be explained by winter severity.

* 4Adult spring survival was surprisingly high, averaging 0·892 (=~0·028). No evidence for increased mortality during hibernation could be found. This contradicted the expectation of reduced over-winter survival due to depleted fat reserves at the end of hibernation. Thus, hibernation does apparently not entail a survival cost for the pipistrelle bat. Rough estimates of annual adult survival averaged 0·799 (~=~0·051), which considerably exceeds previous estimates; annual juvenile survival was estimated at 0·527 (~=~0·095). Hence, previous studies have substantially underestimated pipistrelle bat survival. Possible consequences of these findings for various aspects of life histories are discussed.},

 abstract = {Many long-distance migrating shorebird (i.e., sandpipers, plovers, flamingos, oystercatchers) populations are declining. Although regular shorebird monitoring programs exist worldwide, most estimates of shorebird population trends and sizes are poor or nonexistent. We built a state-space model to estimate shorebird population trends. Compared with more commonly used methods of trend estimation, state-space models are more mechanistic, allow for the separation of observation and state process, and can easily accommodate multivariate time series and nonlinear trends. We fitted the model to count data collected from 1990 to 2013 on 18 common shorebirds at the 2 largest coastal wetlands in southern Africa, Sandwich Harbour (a relatively pristine bay) and Walvis Bay (an international harbor), Namibia. Four of the 12 long-distance migrant species declined since 1990: Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres), Little Stint (Calidris minuta), Common Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula), and Red Knot (Calidris canutus). Populations of resident species and short-distance migrants increased or were stable. Similar patterns at a key South African wetland suggest that shorebird populations migrating to southern Africa are declining in line with the global decline, but local conditions in southern Africa's largest wetlands are not contributing to these declines. State-space models provide estimates of population levels and trends and could be used widely to improve the current state of water bird estimates.},

 abstract = {The African estrildid finch Pyrenestes ostrinus exhibits a polymorphism in bill size that is not related to sex. This paper examines the feeding ecology, sessonal changes in abundance, and diet overlap of the two bill morphs on a study are in south---central Cameroon. The morphs fed on two major sedge species, hard and soft. The diets of the small--- and large---billed morphs were influenced by their feeding efficiencies on the sedges and seed abundance. When both major sedges were abundant, diet overlap between morphs was high, but overlap declined during the major dry season when overall food abundance was low. During the dry season, large---billed morphs specialized on the hard---seeded sedge species while small---billed morphs broadened their diet to include other foods. This pattern of resource use is consistent with increased intraspecific compeition for food and similar to patterns of resource use between distinct species during food---lean times. A model for the evolution of the polymorphism is presented.},

 abstract = {Understanding effects of harvest on population dynamics is of major interest, especially for declining species. European lapwing Vanellus vanellus populations increased from the 1960s until the 1980s and declined strongly thereafter. About 400,000 lapwings are harvested annually and it is thus of high conservation relevance to assess whether hunting was a main cause for the observed changes in lapwing population trends. We developed a multi-event cause-specific mortality model which we applied to a long-term ring-recovery data set (1960-2010) of {\textgreater} 360,000 records to estimate survival and cause-specific mortalities. We found no temporal change in survival over the last 50 years for first-year (FY) and older birds (after first-year; AFY) originating from different ringing areas. Mean survival was high, around 0.60 and 0.80 for FY and AFY individuals, respectively. The proportion of total mortality due to hunting was {\textless}0.10 over the study period and the estimated proportion of harvested individuals (kill rate) was {\textless}0.05 in each year. Our result of constant survival indicates that demographic processes other than survival were responsible for the pronounced change in lapwing population trends in the 1980s. Our findings lend support to the hypothesis that hunting was not a significant contributor to the large-scale decline of lapwing populations. To halt the ongoing decline of European lapwing populations management should focus on life history stages other than survival (e.g. productivity). Further analyses are required to investigate the contribution of other demographic rates to the decline of lapwings and to identify the most efficient conservation actions.},

 abstract = {In migrant animals, conditions encountered at various times and places throughout their annual cycle may affect breeding success. Yet, most studies so far have only investigated the effect of specific parts of the annual cycle, despite the importance to understand how different stages can interact and how these stages compare to intrinsic quality to properly modulate breeding success. Using a structural equation modelling approach, we investigated drivers of breeding success (migration cycle, individual quality, breeding conditions) in hoopoes Upupa epops, a long-distant migrant. Our causal framework explained 75{\%} of the variation in breeding success. The effect of the migration schedule was negligible, whereas the previous breeding attempt strongly influenced current breeding success. We suggest that the interplay of individual quality and environmental conditions during both previous and current breeding season may be more important drivers of breeding success than migration schedules, even in a long-distance migrant. We conclude that structural equation modeling is a promising tool to investigate causal relationships. Applied to hoopoes, we demonstrated that current breeding success is strongly linked to previous breeding success. Complementary analysis integrating weather and climate conditions during migration and the breeding season may provide a deeper and wider overview of the annual cycle of hoopoes and additional insights into the existence of carry-over effects in breeding success.},

 abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) protein, resulting in acquisition of toxic functions. Previous studies have shown that lowering mutant HTT has the potential to be broadly beneficial. We previously identified HTT single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tightly linked to the HD mutation and developed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting HD-SNPs that selectively suppress mutant HTT. We tested allele-specific ASOs in a mouse model of HD. Both early and late treatment reduced cognitive and behavioral impairments in mice. To determine the translational potential of the treatment, we examined the effect of ASO administration on HTT brain expression in nonhuman primates. The treatment induced robust HTT suppression throughout the cortex and limbic system, areas implicated in cognition and psychiatric function. The results suggest that ASOs specifically targeting mutated HTT might have therapeutic effects on HD-mediated cognitive impairments.},

 abstract = {The contemporary summer populations of three species of bats, the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), the brown long-eared bat (Plecorus auritus) and Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) in an area of 3200 km2. in N.E. Scotland (57°N), near to the northern borders of their distributions, were assessed by surveying nursery roosts. A total of 184 roosts were discovered between 1973 and 1989, and the species in occupation was identified at 147 of these. Of the roosts with identified occupants. 109 were occupied by pipistrelles. Most pipistrelle roosts were located close to the major rivers. The mean roost size in early summer for pipistrelles was 117 individuals. The larger roosts were predominantly (98.8{\%}) female (n= 165). Captured bats foraging on the rivers were only 67{\%}) female (n= 102) which indicated there was also a large population ofmales which the roost survey did not detect. The minimum density of females in the occupied habitat was estimated at 18.2 bats per km2. This contemporary population in the study area is much greater than was indicated in historical records from the 19th century. There was no evidence that the populations of pipistrelles, near to the northern border of their distribution. was reduced when compared with populations further south. Thirty-four of the roosts were occupied by brown long-eared bats. These roosts were located predominantly along a short(25 km). well wooded section of the River Dee. The mean roost size in early summer for brown long-eared bats was 16.8 individuals. On average, these roosts were predominantly female(69.6{\%}, n = 273), but contained a variable proportion of immature and occasionally mature males. The density of brown long-eared bats in the occupied habitat was 1.66 bats per km2, less than a tenth the density of pipistrelles. Historically, this bat was more widespread and abundant in the area. There were only four identified roosts of Daubenton's bats, containing in total about 300 individuals. In all these cases, the roosts were located immediately adjacent to the major rivers, and in two of the cases were also close to areas of open water. A survey of 72 bridges in the area revealed only two individual Daubenton's bats. The density of Daubenton's bats in the occupied habitat was around2--4 bats per km2. There has been a substantial reduction in the population of this bat in the area over historical times. At the turn of the century it was the commonest bat in the area, but currently it is the rarest. The causes of the decline are uncertain but are unlikely to reflect draining of areas of open water or the activities of anglers.},

@article{Stier.2014,
 abstract = {The short favorable period of time available for the growth in seasonal environments could constrain the resources allocation between growth and other life-history traits, and the short-term fitness benefits of increased growth rate may prevail over other functions. Accelerated growth rates have been associated with long-term deleterious consequences (e.g., decreased lifespan), and recently oxidative stress (the imbalance between pro-oxidants generation and antioxidant defenses) has been suggested as a mediator of these effects. Here, we examined the impact of elevation on growth rate and self-maintenance parameters (resting metabolism, oxidative damage, and antioxidant defenses) of coal tit chicks (Periparus ater). We predicted that the shorter favorable season at the higher-elevation site could lead to a reallocation of resources towards growth at the expense of self-maintenance processes. We found that chicks at high elevation grew significantly faster in terms of body mass and body size. Chicks from the high-elevation site presented higher resting metabolism, higher oxidative damage level, but similar antioxidant defenses, compared to low-elevation chicks. Interestingly, the chicks exhibiting the better antioxidant defenses at 7 days were also those with the highest resting metabolic rate, and the chicks that grew at the faster rate within the high-elevation site were those with the highest levels of oxidative damage on DNA. Our study supports the idea that increasing elevation leads to a higher growth rate in coal tit chicks, possibly in response to a shorter favorable season. In accordance with life-history theory, a bigger investment in growth was done at the expense of body maintenance, at least in terms of oxidative stress.},

@article{Stre.2012,
 abstract = {The current, virtually worldwide distribution of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a result of its commensal relationship with humans. It has been suggested that long before the advent of agriculture, an early glacial advance resulted in two disjunct ranges of ancestral house sparrows - one in the Middle East and another on the Indian subcontinent. Differentiation during this period of isolation resulted in two major groups of subspecies: the domesticus group and the indicus group. According to this hypothesis, commensalism with humans would have evolved independently in the two regions and at least twice. An alternative hypothesis is that morphological differences between the subspecies represent very recent differentiation, following expansions from a single source. To test between these hypotheses, we analysed genetic variation at the mitochondrial DNA control region and at three nuclear loci from several house sparrow populations in Europe, Asia and North Africa. No differentiation between the indicus and domesticus groups was found, supporting the single origin hypothesis. One of the subspecies in the indicus group, P. d. bactrianus, differs ecologically from other house sparrows in being migratory and in preferentially breeding in natural habitat. We suggest that bactrianus represents a relict population of the ancestral, noncommensal house sparrow. When agricultural societies developed in the Middle East about 10 000 years ago, a local house sparrow population of the bactrianus type adapted to the novel environment and eventually became a sedentary, human commensal. As agriculture and human civilizations expanded, house sparrows experienced a correlated and massive expansion in range and numbers. The pattern of genetic variation analysed here is consistent with this scenario.},

Wood thrushes from the same breeding population occupied winter territories within a narrow east-west band in Central America, suggesting high connectivity of breeding and wintering populations. Pace of spring migration was rapid (233 to 577 kilometers/day) except for one individual (159 kilometers/day) who took an overland route instead of crossing the Gulf of Mexico. Identifying songbird wintering areas and migration routes is critical for predicting demographic consequences of habitat loss and climate change in tropical regions.},

Based on eight nuclear microsatellite loci (n~= 353), we observed similarities between the species in Poland with respect to heterozygosity, allelic richness, mean relatedness, and inbreeding coefficients. However, pronounced differences in migratory patterns (shown by assignment tests) suggest that P.~pygmaeus is the more migratory species. The proportion of bats migrating between colonies differed significantly, with 17.1{\%} and 41.8{\%} individuals of P.~pygmaeus and P.~pipistrellus, respectively, confidently assigned to colonies of origin. Both species demonstrated a more migratory character in central Europe compared with the populations from the British Isles.

These survivors might have survived better because of a better body condition. We also examined the relation ships between growth bar width and reproductive parameters (arrival date, pairing date and reproductive success). Males with wider growth bars arrived earlier, acquired a mate earlier and achieved higher total reproductive success by breeding twice. In females, growth bar width was correlated with reproductive parameters (arrival date, pairing date and total reproductive success), but not with survival. These results suggest that males with wider growth bars were of higher quality than those with narrower bars. The contrasting results for the two sexes may be explained by differences in their breeding tactics.},

Between 1977 and 1984, around York in the north of England, 1328 pipistrelle bats were ringed. Ninety adult females were ringed in 1977, and from capture, release and recapture data life tables for an unaged female cohort were constructed. Age-specific survival rate for adult females on the Vale of York was 0--64 per year. Three bats from the original 1977 cohort were recaptured in 1984 and are likely to have been at least eight years old. Juvenile female pipistrelles appear to survive less well than adults.},

 abstract = {Dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) from two elevations in the Rocky Mountains of Canada display different life histories. Birds breeding at high elevation face a later and compressed reproductive season during which they raise on average half the number of broods (young) than their low-elevation conspecifics. Fledglings at high elevation are heavier, fatter, and have an increased chance of surviving to 25 days of age. Likewise, survival of adults (males) increases at higher elevation. Put into a broader perspective, high-elevation juncos show the life-history strategy characteristic for low-latitude birds. This raises questions about the mechanisms influencing life-history evolution.},

@article{Tris.2004,
 abstract = {Migratory strategies of birds require complex orientation mechanisms, morphological adaptations, and life-history adjustments. From an evolutionary perspective, it is important to know how fast this complex combination of traits can evolve. We analyzed mitochondrial control-region DNA sequences in 241 blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) from 12 populations with different migratory behaviors. The sample included sedentary populations in Europe and Atlantic archipelagos and migratory populations with different distances of migration, from regional to intercontinental migrations, and different heading directions (due to a migratory divide in central Europe). There was no genetic structure between migratory and sedentary populations, or among populations from different biogeographic areas (Atlantic islands, the Iberian Peninsula, or the continent), however we found evidence of a genetic structure when comparing populations located on either side of the migratory divide. These findings support an independent evolution of highly divergent migratory strategies in blackcaps, occurring after a postglacial colonization of the continent along western and eastern routes. Accordingly, mismatch-distribution analyses suggested an expansion of blackcaps from a very small population size, and time estimates dated such an expansion during the last postglacial period. However, the populations in Gibraltar, located in a putative Mediterranean refuge, appeared to be independent of these processes, showing evidence of restricted gene flow with other populations and demonstrating insignificant historical changes in effective population size. Our results show that the interruption of gene flow between migratory and sedentary populations is not necessary for the maintenance of such a polymorphism, and that even the most divergent migratory strategies of a bird species are susceptible to evolution in response to historical environmental changes.},

In the 1970--1996 period this trend was significant for Pied Wagtail, Wood Pigeon, Black Redstart and Barn Swallow, and marginally significant for a further four species: European Serin, Blackcap, Common Nightingale and Red-backed Shrike. Only two species showed the opposite trend in the 1970--1996 period: Lesser Whitethroat and Whinchat, of which only the former is (marginally) significant. The trend towards earliness was more pronounced for short-distance (European) migrants than for long-distance (African) migrants. Short-distance migrants generally displayed a correlation with spring temperatures in the breeding locality, a feature less obvious in the long-distance migrants.},

@article{vanDoren.2017,
 abstract = {Billions of nocturnally migrating birds move through increasingly photopolluted skies, relying on cues for navigation and orientation that artificial light at night (ALAN) can impair. However, no studies have quantified avian responses to powerful ground-based light sources in urban areas. We studied effects of ALAN on migrating birds by monitoring the beams of the National September 11 Memorial {\&} Museum's {\dq}Tribute in Light{\dq} in New York, quantifying behavioral responses with radar and acoustic sensors and modeling disorientation and attraction with simulations. This single light source induced significant behavioral alterations in birds, even in good visibility conditions, in this heavily photopolluted environment, and to altitudes up to 4 km. We estimate that the installation influenced $\approx$1.1 million birds during our study period of 7 d over 7 y. When the installation was illuminated, birds aggregated in high densities, decreased flight speeds, followed circular flight paths, and vocalized frequently. Simulations revealed a high probability of disorientation and subsequent attraction for nearby birds, and bird densities near the installation exceeded magnitudes 20 times greater than surrounding baseline densities during each year's observations. However, behavioral disruptions disappeared when lights were extinguished, suggesting that selective removal of light during nights with substantial bird migration is a viable strategy for minimizing potentially fatal interactions among ALAN, structures, and birds. Our results also highlight the value of additional studies describing behavioral patterns of nocturnally migrating birds in powerful lights in urban areas as well as conservation implications for such lighting installations.},

 abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that snowy owls Nyctea scandiaca defend an area around their nests against

predators, hereby inadvertently creating safe havens for breeding dark-bellied brent geese Branta b. bernicla .

However, studies investigating brent goose breeding ecology within the predator-exclusion zones of the snowy

owls are absent. In 1999 and 2005, years of high lemming abundance Lemmus sibiricus and Dicrostonyx

torquatus , brent geese were primarily breeding in association with snowy owls in the Medusa river catchment on

western Taimyr, Russia. Goose nest failure, either as a result of nest abandonment by the adult birds or of nest

depredation, increased with increasing distance from the owl nests. Within the brent goose colonies, clutch size

as well as egg size increased with decreasing distance from the snowy owl nest, indicating an increasing adult

quality closer to owl nests. However, as a result of the abandonment of eggs and goslings, the increasing clutch

size did not result in a higher nest success during this study. Apparently brent geese compete for breeding sites

close to owl nests, but details of this process remain unknown},

 abstract = {The exploration of animal migration has entered a new era with individual-based tracking during multiple years. Here, we investigated repeated migratory journeys of a long-distance migrating bird, the marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus, in order to analyse the variation within and between individuals with respect to routes and timing. We found that there was a stronger individual repeatability in time than in space. Thus, the annual timing of migration varied much less between repeated journeys of the same individual than between different individuals, while there was considerable variation in the routes of the same individual on repeated journeys. The overall contrast in repeatability between time and space was unexpected and may be owing to strong endogenous control of timing, while short-term variation in environmental conditions (weather and habitat) might promote route flexibility. The individual variation in migration routes indicates that the birds navigate mainly by other means than detailed route recapitulation based on landmark recognition.},

Nineteen bats were radiotagged and 37 roost trees identified. Pipistrelles roosted exclusively in foliage, typically in clusters of dead leaves (65{\%}) and less often in live foliage (30{\%}) or squirrel nests (5{\%}). Oaks (Quercus species) were preferred as roost trees. Roost trees and height of foliage roosts were both located well below the forest canopy. Bats remained at roost trees for 6 days on average before moving to new roosts and traveled approximately 19--139 m between roost trees. This is the 1st thorough analysis of roosting habits of this common species under natural conditions.},

@article{Vickery.2001b,
 abstract = {Many farmland bird populations have exhibited marked declines in the last 20--30 years and there is growing evidence to link these declines to agricultural intensification. Field margin management is frequently proposed as a way of enhancing bird populations but there have been few attempts to assess the relative value of different management options. This paper aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the relative value of six different cereal field margin management practices in providing foraging habitats for farmland birds. It also briefly compares these with the benefits afforded by field and whole farm approaches such as set-aside and organic farming, to wildlife conservation on arable land. The field margins considered are: grass margins (separated into grass-only strips and grass/wildflower strips), naturally regenerated set-aside margins, uncropped wildlife strips, game cover crops and conservation headlands. Sympathetically managed field margins can provide a range of plant and invertebrate food resources for birds both in summer and winter. In general, the best winter food supplies (mainly seeds) will be provided by game cover crops and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips. The most abundant summer food supplies (invertebrates and seeds) will be provided by a diverse sward; grass/wildflower strips, uncropped wildlife strips and naturally regenerated rotational set-aside strips followed by conservation headlands. Field margin swards that are less diverse in terms of species composition and structural heterogeneity and that consequently support fewer invertebrates, can, nonetheless, provide higher quality foraging habitats for birds than an intensively managed crop up to the hedge base. A number of bird species such as yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), prefer to forage in margins in winter and summer and many of the benefits of whole field approaches such as set-aside, overwinter stubbles and undersown cereals, could be gained from margins under the same management. Whole-field approaches are, however, required for boundary-avoiding species such as skylark (Alauda arvensis) and lapwing (Vanellus vanellus). Less is known about the use other birds make of margins, relative to their use of field centres in winter. Whole farm approaches such as organic farming, whilst being highly beneficial to birds, are likely to remain rather localised in the UK, whereas field margin management can be relatively easily incorporated into the farmed landscape on an extensive scale.},

 abstract = {Wind turbines are increasingly established throughout Europe and North America with often fatal consequences for wildlife, most importantly bats and birds. Yet, it is often unknown over what geographical distances wind farms are affecting animal populations. Based on stable hydrogen isotopes in fur, we assessed the geographic provenance of bats killed in summer and autumn at German wind turbines. We found that killed Pipistrellus nathusii originated from Estonia or Russia, and Pipistrellus pipistrellus from more local populations. Noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) and Leisler's bats (Nyctalus leisleri) were of Scandinavian or northeastern origin. Our isotopic geo-location reveals that wind turbines kill bats not only of sedentary local populations but also of distant populations, thus having potentially a negative impact beyond political borders; an observation that calls for international regulations for implementing mitigation measures to prevent large-scale detrimental effects on endangered bat populations.},

 abstract = {Many European migratory bat species hibernate in large hollow trees, a decreasing resource in present day silviculture. Here, we report on the importance of man-made hibernacula to support trans-boundary populations of noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula), a species that performs seasonal long distance movements throughout Europe. In winter, we surveyed nine bat roosts (eight artificial and one natural) in Germany and collected small tufts of fur from a total of 608 individuals. We then measured the stable isotope ratios of the non-exchangeable hydrogen in fur keratin and estimated the origin of migrants using a refined isoscape origin model that included information on expected flight distances and migration directions. According to the stable isotope signature, 78 {\%} of hibernating bats originated from local populations. The remaining 22 {\%} of hibernacula occupants originated from distant populations, mostly from places in northern or eastern countries such as Sweden, Poland and Baltic countries. Our results confirm that many noctule bats cross one or several political borders during migration. Data on the breeding origin of hibernating noctule bats also suggest that artificial roosts may not only be important for local but also for distant populations. Protection of natural and artificial hibernacula in managed forests may support the trans-boundary populations of migratory bats when hollow trees are scarce in managed forests.},

@article{Wade.2014,
 abstract = {Concern that European forest biodiversity is depleted and declining has provoked widespread efforts to improve management practices. To gauge the success of these actions, appropriate monitoring of forest ecosystems is paramount. Multi-species indicators are frequently used to assess the state of biodiversity and its response to implemented management, but generally applicable and objective methodologies for species' selection are lacking. Here we use a niche-based approach, underpinned by coarse quantification of species' resource use, to objectively select species for inclusion in a pan-European forest bird indicator. We identify both the minimum number of species required to deliver full resource coverage and the most sensitive species' combination, and explore the trade-off between two key characteristics, sensitivity and redundancy, associated with indicators comprising different numbers of species. We compare our indicator to an existing forest bird indicator selected on the basis of expert opinion and show it is more representative of the wider community. We also present alternative indicators for regional and forest type specific monitoring and show that species' choice can have a significant impact on the indicator and consequent projections about the state of the biodiversity it represents. Furthermore, by comparing indicator sets drawn from currently monitored species and the full forest bird community, we identify gaps in the coverage of the current monitoring scheme. We believe that adopting this niche-based framework for species' selection supports the objective development of multi-species indicators and that it has good potential to be extended to a range of habitats and taxa.},

 abstract = {In regression analysis, ridge estimators are often used to alleviate the problem of multicollinearity. Ridge estimators have traditionally been evaluated using the risk under quadratic loss criterion, which places sole emphasis on estimators' precision. Here, we consider the balanced loss function (A. Zellner, in: S.S. Gupta, J.O. Berger (Eds.), Statistical Decision Theory and Related Topics, vol. V, Springer, New York, 1994, p. 377) which incorporates a measure for the goodness of fit of the model as well as estimation precision. By adopting this loss we derive and numerically evaluate the risks of the feasible generalized ridge and the almost unbiased feasible generalized ridge estimators. We show that in the case of severe multicollinearity, the feasible generalized ridge estimator often produces the greatest risk reductions, even if a relatively heavy weight is given to goodness of fit in the balanced loss function.

@article{Wang.2002,
 abstract = {Global climate change may impact wildlife populations by affecting local weather patterns, which, in turn, can impact a variety of ecological processes. However, it is not clear that local variations in ecological processes can be explained by large-scale patterns of climate. The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) is a large-scale climate phenomenon that has been shown to influence the population dynamics of some animals. Although effects of the NAO on vertebrate population dynamics have been studied, it remains uncertain whether it broadly predicts the impact of weather on species. We examined the ability of local weather data and the NAO to explain the annual variation in population dynamics of white-tailed ptarmigan ( Lagopus leucurus) in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA. We performed canonical correlation analysis on the demographic subspace of ptarmigan and local-climate subspace defined by the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) using data from 1975 to 1999. We found that two subspaces were significantly correlated on the first canonical variable. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the first EOF values of the demographic and local-climate subspaces was significant. The population density and the first EOF of local-climate subspace influenced the ptarmigan population with 1-year lags in the Gompertz model. However, the NAO index was neither related to the first two EOF of local-climate subspace nor to the first EOF of the demographic subspace of ptarmigan. Moreover, the NAO index was not a significant term in the Gompertz model for the ptarmigan population. Therefore, local climate had stronger signature on the demography of ptarmigan than did a large-scale index, i.e., the NAO index. We conclude that local responses of wildlife populations to changing climate may not be adequately explained by models that project large-scale climatic patterns.},

@article{Ward.2014,
 abstract = {An individual's reproductive success will depend on traits that increase access to mates, as well as the number of mates available. In most well-studied mammals, males are the larger sex, and body size often increases success in intra-sexual contests and thus paternity. In comparison, the determinants of male success in species with reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSD) are less well understood. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) exhibit RSD and females appear to exert mate choice when they visit and copulate with males in their underground territories. Here we assessed putative determinants of reproductive success in a colony of greater horseshoe bats during a 19-year period of rapid population growth. We genotyped 1080 bats with up to 40 microsatellite loci and assigned maternity to 99.5{\%} of pups, and paternity to 76.8{\%} of pups. We found that in spite of RSD, paternity success correlated positively with male size, and, consistent with our previous findings, also with age. Female reproductive success, which has not previously been studied in this population, was also age-related and correlated positively with individual heterozygosity, but not with body size. Remarkable male reproductive skew was detected that initially increased steadily with population size, possibly coinciding with the saturation of suitable territories, but then levelled off suggesting an upper limit to a male's number of partners. Our results illustrate that RSD can occur alongside intense male sexual competition, that male breeding success is density-dependent, and that male and female greater horseshoe bats are subject to different selective pressures.},

By sampling birds and mammals, we found that the distribution of the evolutionary ages of sister species-pairs of species in which each is the other's closest relative-adheres to a latitudinal gradient. The time to divergence for sister species is shorter at high latitudes and longer in the tropics. Birth-death models fitting these data estimate that the highest recent speciation and extinction rates occur at high latitudes and decline toward the tropics. These results conflict with the prevailing view that links high tropical diversity to elevated tropical speciation rates. Instead, our findings suggest that faster turnover at high latitudes contributes to the latitudinal diversity gradient.},

@article{Wellig.2018,
 abstract = {Wind turbines represent a source of hazard for bats, especially through collision with rotor blades. With increasing technical development, tall turbines (rotor-swept zone 50-150 m above ground level) are becoming widespread, yet we lack quantitative information about species active at these heights, which impedes proposing targeted mitigation recommendations for bat-friendly turbine operation. We investigated vertical activity profiles of a bat assemblage, and their relationships to wind speed, within a major valley of the European Alps where tall wind turbines are being deployed. To monitor bat activity we installed automatic recorders at sequentially increasing heights from ground level up to 65 m, with the goal to determine species-specific vertical activity profiles and to link them to wind speed. Bat call sequences were analysed with an automatic algorithm, paying particular attention to mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii) and the European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis), three locally rare species. The most often recorded bats were the Common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Mouse-eared bats were rarely recorded, and mostly just above ground, appearing out of risk of collision. T. teniotis had a more evenly distributed vertical activity profile, often being active at rotor level, but its activity at that height ceased above 5 ms-1 wind speed. Overall bat activity in the rotor-swept zone declined with increasing wind speed, dropping below 5{\%} above 5.4 ms-1. Collision risk could be drastically reduced if nocturnal operation of tall wind turbines would be restricted to wind speeds above 5 ms-1. Such measure should be implemented year-round because T. teniotis remains active in winter. This operational restriction is likely to cause only small energy production losses at these tall wind turbines, although further analyses are needed to assess these losses precisely.},

@article{Wilkinson.2002,
 abstract = {The evolutionary theory of aging predicts that life span should decrease in response to the amount of mortality caused by extrinsic sources. Using this prediction, we selected six life history and ecological factors to use in a comparative analysis of longevity among 64 bat species. On average, the maximum recorded life span of a bat is 3.5 times greater than a non-flying placental mammal of similar size. Records of individuals surviving more than 30~years in the wild now exist for five species. Univariate and multivariate analyses of species data, as well as of phylogenetically independent contrasts obtained using a supertree of Chiroptera, reveal that bat life span significantly increases with hibernation, body mass and occasional cave use, but decreases with reproductive rate and is not influenced by diet, colony size or the source of the record. These results are largely consistent with extrinsic mortality risk acting as a determinant of bat longevity. Nevertheless, the strong association between life span and both reproductive rate and hibernation also suggests that bat longevity is strongly influenced by seasonal allocation of non-renewable resources to reproduction. We speculate that hibernation may provide a natural example of caloric restriction, which is known to increase longevity in other mammals.},

 abstract = {ZusammenfassungNach einer von Merkel und Fromme (1958) entwickelten und in einigen Punkten verbesserten Methode wurden von 1963 bis 1966 in 775 Zugn{\"a}chten 102 Rotkehlchen auf ihre Zugorientierung untersucht. Dabei wurde festgestellt:1Die Versuchstiere sind in der Lage, in geschlossenen R{\"a}umen ihre Zugrichtung einzuhalten, sofern die Totalintensit{\"a}t des Erdmagnetfeldes (0,41 Gau{\ss}) unver{\"a}ndert ist (Abb. 4 a, 4 b, 4 c, 6 a und 6 b, 12 c).2In k{\"u}nstlichen Magnetfeldern von ann{\"a}hernd Erdfeldst{\"a}rke bedingt eine {\"A}nderung der magnetischen Nordrichtung eine entsprechende {\"A}nderung der Zugrichtung (Abb. 14).3In k{\"u}nstlichen Magnetfeldern von etwa doppelter Erdfeldst{\"a}rke l{\"a}{\ss}t sich bisher keine Zugorientierung nachweisen (Abb. 11, 12 a, 12 b).4In R{\"a}umen mit schw{\"a}cherer magnetischer Totalintensit{\"a}t als der des Erdfeldes --- 0,30 bzw. 0,14 Gau{\ss} - l{\"a}{\ss}t sich ebenfalls keine Zugorientierung nachweisen (Abb. 5, 8 a, 9 a, 10).5Werden die Versuchsv{\"o}gel bei 0,14 Gau{\ss} gehalten, ist die Zugorientierung auch bei 0,14 Gau{\ss} nachweisbar (Abb. 7 a, 7 b, 8 b). Diese Zugrichtung ist durch k{\"u}nstliche Magnetfelder von 0,30 bzw. 0,41 Gau{\ss} zu beeinflussen (Abb. 13).},

- Die Abwanderungsrate hat sich zwischen 1960 und 1989 signifikant verkleinert.

@article{Wood.2018,
 abstract = {Neuronal and non-neuronal cells express the huntingtin protein, yet neurodegeneration in Huntington's Disease (HD) is largely selective, affecting most prominently striatal medium spiny neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons. Selective toxicity of full-length mutant huntingtin (fl-mHTT) may be due in part to its expression in non-neuronal cells. While studies suggest neuronal-glial interactions are important in HD and fl-mHTT is expressed in astrocytes, it has not been determined whether the expression of fl-mHTT in astrocytes is necessary for HD pathogenesis. To directly assess the necessity of fl-mHTT in astrocytes for HD pathogenesis, we used a mouse genetic approach and bred the conditional mutant huntingtin expressing BACHD mouse model with GFAP-CreERT2 mice. We show that GFAP-CreERT2 expression in these mice is highly selective for astrocytes and we are able to significantly reduce the expression of fl-mHTT protein in the striatum and cortex of BACHD/GFAP-CreERT2-tam mice. We performed behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuropathological analyses of BACHD and BACHD/GFAP-CreERT2-tam mice. Behavioral analyses of BACHD/GFAP-CreERT2-tam mice demonstrate significant improvements in motor and psychiatric-like phenotypes. We observe improvements in neuropathological and electrophysiological phenotypes in BACHD/GFAP-CreERT2-tam mice compared to BACHD mice. We observed a restoration of the normal level \textgreek{a}B-crystallin in the striatum of the BACHD/GFAP-CreERT2 mice, indicating a cell autonomous effect of mHTT on its expression. Taken together, this work indicates that astrocytes are important contributors to the progression of the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes observed in HD.},

 abstract = {Some cave-dwelling bat species such as Myotis myotis now also roost in buildings in parts of their range. I studied the effects of roost temperature and colony size on reproductive success of colonies of M. myotis located in buildings. Temperatures in attics fluctuated considerably and altered the thermal conditions at the roost during the breeding season. Inter-colony variation was recorded with respect to factors indicating reproductive success (number, growth, and mortality of juveniles until fledging). However, over-winter survival varied more between years than between colonies. Colony size did not influence development or mortality of juveniles. High average roost temperatures favoured development of juveniles but did not influence mortality. Unlike the situation in caves, large colony sizes are not advantageous in buildings},

Considerable variations of the parasite load between host species, ages and sexes were found, which can be attributed to roosting conditions and behavioural differences of the bats. Overall, male bats had the fewest parasites. Very different parasite population densities were found in different years, and also at the same time at different sites. A generally high parasite load during the nursing season was not observed. There was no strong trend of increasing parasite load in bats with decreasing condition. If weak bats had more parasites than other individuals, the high number of parasites seemed to be a symptom and not the direct cause of the bad condition.},

 abstract = {We studied the regional variation in population density of Myotis myotis (Borkhausen 1797) in south-eastern Bavaria, Germany, and its relations to diet composition and the availability of potential foraging habitats. We monitored colony size and juvenile mortality from 1991 to 2003, conducted faecal analyses in 1993 and determined land-use patterns around colonies. The numbers of individuals counted in the nursery colonies showed only small fluctuations over the years. However, data on colony size demonstrated a pronounced regional variation. Epigeic arthropods, mainly Carabidae, were the most important prey. The diet included prey taxa of forest as well as grassland habitats. The percentage of those prey taxa in the diet that originated in grassland managed with different intensity varied according to the availability of these potential foraging habitats around the nursery roosts. The calculated population density of the bats was positively correlated to forest area and especially to the area of mixed forest around the nursery roosts. Our results indicate that the availability of foraging habitats is a limiting factor for local population densities in the greater mouse-eared bat.},

@article{Zhang.2010,
 abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the gene Huntingtin (Htt). A dramatic pathological change in HD is the massive loss of striatal neurons as the disease progresses. A useful advance in HD would be the generation of a human-derived HD model to use for drug screening and understanding mechanisms of HD. We utilized the recently established human iPS cell line derived from HD patient fibroblasts to derive neuronal precursors and human striatal neurons. To achieve this goal, the differentiation of the HD-iPS cells into striatal fate required several steps. First, we generated nestin+/PAX6+/SOX1+/OCT4- neural stem cells (NSCs) from HD-iPS cells using the method of embryoid body formation. HD-NSCs were then subjected to a differentiation condition combining morphogens and neurotrophins to induce striatal lineage commitment. Striatal neuronal precursors/immature neurons stained with \textgreek{b}-III tubulin, calbindin and GABA but not DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr = 32,000) were produced in this step. Finally, maturation and terminal differentiation of the striatal neuronal precursors/immature neurons resulted in striatal neurons expressing markers like DARPP-32. The HD-iPS cells derived striatal neurons and neuronal precursors contain the same CAG expansion as the mutation in the HD patient from whom the iPS cell line was established. Moreover, the HD-NSCs showed enhanced caspase activity upon growth factor deprivation compared to normal NSCs (from iPS or H9 NSCs). Therefore, these differentiated cells may produce a human HD cell model useful in the study of HD mechanisms and drug screening.},
