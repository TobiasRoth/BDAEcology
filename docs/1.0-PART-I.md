During our courses we are sometimes asked to give an introduction to some R-related stuff covering data analysis, presentation of results or rather specialist topics in ecology. In this part we present collected these introduction and try to keep them updated. This is also a commented collection of R-code that we documented for our own work. We hope this might be useful olso for other readers.
