THIS CHAPTER IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!! 

## Introduction

The prior is an integral part of a Bayesian model. We must specify one.  

When to use informative priors: In practise (management, politics etc.) we would like to base our decisions on all information available. Therefore, we consider it to be responsible including informative priors in applied research whenever possible. Priors allow combining information from the literature with information in data or combining information from different data sets.

When using non-informative priors: in basic research when results should only report the information in the current data set. Results from a case study may later be used in a meta-analyses that assumes independence across the different studies included.

### Priors for variance parameters

@Gelman.2006 discusses advantages of using folded t-distributions or cauchy distributions as prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models. 

When specifying t-distributions, we find it hard to imagine how the distributions looks like with what parameter values. Therefore, we simulate values from different distributions and look at the histograms. Because the parameterisation of the t-distribution differst among software language, it is important to use the software the model is finally fitted in Figure \@ref(fig:tdjags) we give some examples of folded t-distributions specified in jags using different values for the precision (second parameter) and degrees of freedom (third parameter).
