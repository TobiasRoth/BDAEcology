### Background

Linear regression is the basis of a large part of applied statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) can be considered special cases of linear regression, and generalized linear models are extensions of linear regression. 

Typical questions that can be answered using linear regression are: How does $y$ change with changes in $x$? How is y predicted from $x$? An ordinary linear regression (i.e., one numeric  $x$  and one numeric $y$  variable) can be represented by a scatterplot of $y$ against $x$. We search for the line that ﬁts best and describe how the observations scatter around this regression line (see Fig. \@ref(fig:figlm) for an example). The model formula of a simple linear regression with one continuous predictor variable $x_i$ (the subscript $i$ denotes the $i=1,\dots,n$ data points) is:

\begin{align} 
  \mu_i &=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i \\
  y_i &\sim Norm(\mu_i, \sigma^2)
  (\#eq:lm)
\end{align}

While the first part of Equation \@ref(eq:lm) describes the regression line, the second part describes the differences between predicted values $\mu_i$ and observations $y_i$. In other words: the observation $y_i$ stems from a normal distribution with mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma^2$ . The mean of the normal distribution, $\mu_i$ , equals the sum of the intercept ($b_0$ ) and the product of the slope ($b_1$) and the continuous predictor value, $x_i$.

The differences between observation $y_i$ and the predicted values $\mu_i$ are the residuals (i.e., $\epsilon_i=y_i-\mu_i$). Equivalently to Equation \@ref(eq:lm), the regression could thus be written as:

\begin{align} 
  y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i\\
  \epsilon_i &\sim Norm(0, \sigma^2)
  (\#eq:lmalternativ)
\end{align} 

We prefer the notation in Equation \@ref(eq:lm) because, in this formula, the stochastic part (second row) is nicely separated from the deterministic part (first row) of the model, whereas, in the second notation \@ref(eq:lmalternativ) the ﬁrst row contains both stochastic and deterministic parts. 

Using matrix notation equation \@ref(eq:lm) can also be written in one row:

$$\boldsymbol{y} \sim 
  Norm(\boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2\boldsymbol{I})$$

where $\boldsymbol{ I}$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix (it transforms the variance parameter to a  $n \times n$ matrix with its diagonal elements equal $\sigma^2$ ; $n$ is the sample size). The multiplication by $\boldsymbol{ I}$ is necessary because we use vector notation, $\boldsymbol{y}$ instead of $y_{i}$ . Here, $\boldsymbol{y}$  is the vector of all observations, whereas $y_{i}$ is a single observation, $i$. When using vector notation, we can write the linear predictor of the model, $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ , as a multiplication of the vector of the model coefﬁcients

$$\boldsymbol{\beta} =
  \begin{pmatrix} 
    \beta_0 \\ 
    \beta_1 
  \end{pmatrix}$$

times the model matrix

$$\boldsymbol{X} = 
  \begin{pmatrix} 
      1     & x_1   \\ 
      \dots & \dots \\ 
      1     & x_n
  \end{pmatrix}$$

where $x_1 , \dots, x_n$ are the observed values for the predictor variable, $x$. The ﬁrst column of $\boldsymbol{X}$ contains only ones because the values in this column are multiplied with the intercept, $\beta_0$ . To the intercept, the product of the second element of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, $\beta_1$ , with each element in the second column of $\boldsymbol{X}$ is added to obtain the predicted value for each observation, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$:

\begin{align} 
\boldsymbol{\beta X}=
\begin{pmatrix} 
	\beta_0 \\ 
	\beta_1 
\end{pmatrix}
\times
\begin{pmatrix} 
      1     & x_1   \\ 
      \dots & \dots \\ 
      1     & x_n
  \end{pmatrix} =
  \begin{pmatrix} 
	\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 \\ 
	\dots \\
	\beta_0 + \beta_1x_n
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix} 
	\hat{y}_1 \\
  \dots \\
	\hat{y}_n 
\end{pmatrix} =
\boldsymbol{\mu}
(\#eq:lmmatrix)
\end{align} 


### Fitting a Linear Regression in R
In Equation \@ref(eq:lm), the predicted (synonym: fitted) values $\mu_i$ are directly deﬁned by the model coefﬁcients, $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ . Therefore, when we can estimate $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$ , and $\sigma^2$, the model is fully deﬁned . The last parameter $\sigma^2$ describes how the observations scatter around the regression line and relies on the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed. The estimates for the model parameters of a linear regression are obtained by searching for the best ﬁtting regression line. To do so, we search for the regression line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. This model ﬁtting method is called the least-squares method, abbreviated as LS. It has a very simple solution using matrix algebra [see e.g., @Aitkin.2009]. 

Note that we can apply LS techniques independent of whether we use a Bayesian or frequentist framework to draw inference. In Bayesian statistics, Equation \@ref(eq:lm) is called the data model, because it describes mathematically the process that has (or, better, that we think has) produced the data. This nomenclature also helps to distinguish data models from models for parameters such as prior distributions.

The least-squares estimates for the model parameters of a linear regression are obtained in R using the function `lm`. For illustration, we ﬁrst simulate a data set and then ﬁt a linear regression to these simulated data. The advantage of simulating data is that the following analyses can be reproduced without having to read data into R.


```r
set.seed(34)            # set a seed for the random number generator
n <- 50                 # sample size
sigma <- 5              # standard deviation of the residuals
b0 <- 2                 # intercept
b1 <- 0.7               # slope

x <- runif(n, 10, 30)   # sample values of the covariate

mu <- b0 + b1 * x
y <- rnorm(n, mu, sd = sigma)

# Save data in table
dat <- tibble(x = x, y = y)
```

Then, we ﬁt a linear regression to the data to obtain the results of the three parameters of the linear regression, that is intercept, slope and residual standard deviation. 


```r
mod <-  lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
coef(mod)
```

```
## (Intercept)           x 
##   2.0049517   0.6880415
```

```r
summary(mod)$sigma
```

```
## [1] 5.04918
```

The object “mod” produced by `lm` contains the estimates for the intercept, $\beta_0$ , and the slope, $\beta_1$. The residual standard deviation $\sigma^2$ is extracted using the function `summary`. We can show the result of the linear regression as a line in  a scatter plot with the covariate (`x`) on the x-axis and the observations (`y`) on the y-axis (Fig. \@ref(fig:figlm)).

<div class="figure">

</div>

Conclusions drawn from a model depend on the model assumptions. When model assumptions are violated, estimates usually are biased and inappropriate conclusions can be drawn. We devote Chapter \@ref(residualanalysis) to the assessment of model assumptions, given its importance.

### Drawing Conclusions

To answer the question about how strongly $y$ is related to $x$, or to predict $y$ from $x$, and because we usually draw inference in a Bayesian framework, we are interested in the joint posterior distribution of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ (vector that contains $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ ) and $\sigma^2$ , the residual variance. The function `sim` does this for us. To somewhat demystify the `sim` function we brieﬂy explain what `sim` does. The principle is to ﬁrst draw a random value from the marginal posterior distribution of $\sigma^2$, and then to draw random values from the conditional posterior distribution for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ [@Gelman.2014].

The conditional posterior distribution of the parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, $p(\boldsymbol{\beta}|\sigma^2,\boldsymbol{y,X})$ is the posterior distribution of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ given a speciﬁc value for $\sigma^2$ . This conditional distribution can be analytically derived. With ﬂat prior distributions, it is a uni- or multivariate normal distribution $p(\boldsymbol{\beta}|\sigma^2,\boldsymbol{y,X})=Norm(\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}},V_\beta,\sigma^2)$ with:

\begin{align}
  \boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}=(\boldsymbol{X^TX})^{-1}X^Ty}
  (\#eq:sim)
\end{align} 

and $V_\beta = (\boldsymbol{X^T X})^{-1}$ . For models with the normal error distribution, the LS estimates for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ (given by Eq. \@ref(eq:sim)) equal the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates ==(see Chapter 5)==.

The marginal posterior distribution of $\sigma^2$ is independent of speciﬁc values of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. It is, for ﬂat prior distributions, an inverse chi-square distribution $p(\sigma^2|\boldsymbol{y,X})=Inv-\chi^2(n-k,\sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-k}(\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X,\hat{\beta}})^T(\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X,\hat{\beta}})$, and $k$ is the number of parameters. The marginal posterior distribution of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ can be obtained by integrating the conditional posterior distribution $p(\boldsymbol{\beta}|\sigma^2,\boldsymbol{y,X})=Norm(\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}},V_\beta\sigma^2)$ over the distribution of $\sigma^2$ . This results in a uni- or multivariate $t$-distribution. 

However, it is not necessary to do this analytically. Using the function `sim` from the package, we can draw samples from $p(\sigma^2|\boldsymbol{y,X})$ and describe the marginal posterior distributions of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ using the simulated values.


```r
library(arm)
nsim <- 1000
bsim <- sim(mod, n.sim = nsim)
```

The function `sim` simulates (in our example) 1000 values from the joint posterior distribution of the three model parameters $\beta_0$ , $\beta_1$, and $\sigma$. These simulated values are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:simfirstexample).

<div class="figure">
<img src="2.03-lm_files/figure-html/simfirstexample-1.png" alt="Joint (scatterplots) and marginal (histograms) posterior distribution of the model parameters.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:simfirstexample)Joint (scatterplots) and marginal (histograms) posterior distribution of the model parameters.

</div>

The posterior distributions describe the range of plausible parameter values given the data and the model. They express our uncertainty about the model parameters; they show what we know about the model parameters after having looked at the data and given the model is realistic.

The 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the marginal posterior distributions can be used as 95% credible intervals of the model parameters. The function `coef` extracts the simulated values for the beta coefﬁcients, returning a matrix with *nsim* rows and the number of columns corresponding to the number of parameters. In our example, the ﬁrst column contains the simulated values from the posterior distribution of the intercept and the second column contains values from the posterior distribution of the slope. The "2" in the second argument of the apply-function (see Chapter \@ref(rmisc)) indicates that the `quantile` function is applied columnwise.


```r
apply(X = coef(bsim), MARGIN = 2, FUN = quantile, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) %>% 
  round(2)
```

```
##       (Intercept)    x
## 2.5%        -2.95 0.44
## 97.5%        7.17 0.92
```

We also can calculate a credible interval of the estimated residual standard deviation, $\hat{\sigma}$.


```r
quantile(bsim@sigma, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) %>% 
  round(1)
```

```
##  2.5% 97.5% 
##   4.2   6.3
```

Using Bayesian methods allows us to get a posterior probability for speciﬁc hypotheses, such as “The slope parameter is larger than 1” or “The slope parameter is larger than 0.5”. These probabilities are the proportion of simulated values from the posterior distribution that are larger than 1 and 0.5, respectively.


```r
sum(coef(bsim)[,2] > 1) / nsim
```

```
## [1] 0.008
```

```r
sum(coef(bsim)[,2] > 0.5) / nsim
```

```
## [1] 0.936
```

From this, there is very little evidence in the data that the slope is larger than 1, but we are quite conﬁdent that the slope is larger than 0.5 (assuming that our model is realistic).

We often want to show the effect of $x$ on $y$ graphically, with information about the uncertainty of the parameter estimates included in the graph. To draw such effect plots, we use the simulated values from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. From the deterministic part of the model, we know the regression line $\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$. The simulation from the joint posterior distribution of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ gives 1000 pairs of intercepts and slopes that describe 1000 different regression lines. We can draw these regression lines in an x-y plot (scatter plot) to show the uncertainty in the regression line estimation (Fig. \@ref(fig:figlmer1), left). Note, that in this case it is not advisable to use `ggplot` because we draw many lines in one plot, which makes `ggplot` rather slow.


```r
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0, 0))
plot(x, y, pch = 16, las = 1, 
     xlab = "Covariate (x)", 
     ylab = "Dependend variable (y)")
for(i in 1:nsim) {
  abline(coef(bsim)[i,1], coef(bsim)[i,2], col = rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.05))
}
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:figlmer1)Regression with 1000 lines based on draws form the joint posterior distribution for the intercept and slope parameters to visualize the uncertainty of the estimated regression line.</p>
</div>

A more convenient way to show uncertainty is to draw the 95% credible interval, CrI, of the regression line. To this end, we ﬁrst deﬁne new x-values for which we would like to have the ﬁtted values (about 100 points across the range of x will produce smooth-looking lines when connected by line segments). We save these new x-values within the new tibble `newdat`. Then, we create a new model matrix that contains these new x-values (`newmodmat`) using the function `model.matrix`. We then calculate the 1000 ﬁtted values for each element of the new x (one value for each of the 1000 simulated regressions, Fig. \@ref(fig:figlmer1)), using matrix multiplication (%*%). We save these values in the matrix “ﬁtmat”. Finally, we extract the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles for each x-value from ﬁtmat, and draw the lines for the lower and upper limits of the credible interval (Fig. \@ref(fig:figlmer2)).


```r
# Calculate 95% credible interval
newdat <- tibble(x = seq(10, 30, by = 0.1))
newmodmat <- model.matrix( ~ x, data = newdat)
fitmat <- matrix(ncol = nsim, nrow = nrow(newdat))
for(i in 1:nsim) {fitmat[,i] <- newmodmat %*% coef(bsim)[i,]}
newdat$CrI_lo <- apply(fitmat, 1, quantile, probs = 0.025)
newdat$CrI_up <- apply(fitmat, 1, quantile, probs = 0.975)

# Make plot
regplot <- 
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_line(data = newdat, aes(x = x, y = CrI_lo), lty = 3) +
  geom_line(data = newdat, aes(x = x, y = CrI_up), lty = 3) +
  labs(x = "Covariate (x)", y = "Dependend variable (y)")
regplot
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="2.03-lm_files/figure-html/figlmer2-1.png" alt="Regression with 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution of the &lt;U+FB01&gt;tted values." width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:figlmer2)Regression with 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution of the <U+FB01>tted values.</p>
</div>

The interpretation of the 95% credible interval is straightforward: We are 95% sure that the true regression line is within the credible interval. As always, this interpretation is only true if the the model is correct. The larger the sample size, the narrower the interval, because each additional data point increases information about the true regression line.

The credible interval measures uncertainty of the regression line, but it does not describe how new observations would scatter around the regression line. If we want to describe where future observations will be, we have to report the posterior predictive distribution. We can get a sample of random draws from the posterior predictive distribution $\hat{y}|\boldsymbol{\beta},\sigma^2,\boldsymbol{X}\sim Norm( \boldsymbol{X \beta, \sigma^2})$ using the simulated joint posterior distributions of the model parameters, thus taking the uncertainty of the parameter estimates into account. We draw a new $\hat{y}$-value from $Norm( \boldsymbol{X \beta, \sigma^2})$ for each simulated set of model parameters. Then, we can visualize the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of this distribution for each new x-value.


```r
# increase number of simulation to procude smooth lines of the posterior
# predictive distribution
set.seed(34)
nsim <- 50000
bsim <- sim(mod, n.sim=nsim)
fitmat <- matrix(ncol=nsim, nrow=nrow(newdat))
for(i in 1:nsim) fitmat[,i] <- newmodmat%*%coef(bsim)[i,]

# prepare matrix for simulated new data
newy <- matrix(ncol=nsim, nrow=nrow(newdat)) 

# for each simulated ﬁtted value, simulate one new y-value
for(i in 1:nsim) {
  newy[,i] <- rnorm(nrow(newdat), mean = fitmat[,i], sd = bsim@sigma[i])
}

# Calculate 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles
newdat$pred_lo <- apply(newy, 1, quantile, probs = 0.025)
newdat$pred_up <- apply(newy, 1, quantile, probs = 0.975)

# Add the posterior predictive distribution to plot
regplot +
  geom_line(data = newdat, aes(x = x, y = pred_lo), lty = 2) +
  geom_line(data = newdat, aes(x = x, y = pred_up), lty = 2)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="2.03-lm_files/figure-html/figlmer3-1.png" alt="Regression line with 95% credible interval (dotted lines) and the 95% interval of the simulated predictive distribution (broken lines). Note that we increased the number of simulations to 50,000 to produce smooth lines." width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:figlmer3)Regression line with 95% credible interval (dotted lines) and the 95% interval of the simulated predictive distribution (broken lines). Note that we increased the number of simulations to 50,000 to produce smooth lines.</p>
</div>

Future observations are expected to be within the interval deﬁned by the broken lines in Fig. \@ref(fig:figlmer3) with a probability of 0.95. Increasing sample size will not necessarily give a narrower predictive distribution because the predictive distribution also depends on the residual variance $\sigma^2$.

The way we produced Fig. \@ref(fig:figlmer3) is somewhat tedious compared to how easy we could have obtained the same ﬁgure using frequentist methods: `predict(mod, newdata = newdat, interval = "prediction")` would have produced the y-values for the lower and upper lines in Fig. \@ref(fig:figlmer3) in one R-code line. However, once we have a simulated sample of the posterior predictive distribution, we have much more information than is contained in the frequentist prediction interval. For example, we could give an estimate for the proportion of observations greater than 20, given $x = 25$.


```r
sum(newy[newdat$x == 25, ] > 20) / nsim
```

```
## [1] 0.44504
```

Thus, we expect 44% of future observations with $x = 25$ to be higher than 20. We can extract similar information for any relevant threshold value.

Another reason to learn the more complicated R code we presented here, compared to the frequentist methods, is that, for more complicated models such as mixed models, the frequentist methods to obtain conﬁdence intervals of ﬁtted values are much more complicated than the Bayesian method just presented. The latter can be used with only slight adaptations for mixed models and also for generalized linear mixed models.

### Frequentist Results
The solution for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is the Equation \@ref(eq:lmmatrix). Most statistical software, including R, return an estimated frequentist standard error for each $\beta_k$. We extract these standard errors together with the estimates for the model parameters using the `summary` function.


```r
summary(mod)
```

```

The summary output ﬁrst gives a rough summary of the residual distribution. However, we will do more rigorous residual analyses in Chapter \@ref(residualanalysis). The estimates of the model coefﬁcients follow. The column "Estimate" contains the estimates for the intercept $\beta_0$ and the slope $\beta_1$ . The column "Std. Error" contains the estimated (frequentist) standard errors of the estimates. The last two columns contain the t-value and the p-value of the classical t-test for the null hypothesis that the coefﬁcient equals zero. The last part of the summary output gives the parameter $\sigma$ of the model, named "residual standard error" and the residual degrees of freedom.

We try to avoid the name "residual standard error" and use "sigma" instead, because $\sigma$ is not a measurement of uncertainty of a parameter estimate like the standard errors of the model coefﬁcients are. $\sigma$ is a model parameter that describes how the observations scatter around the ﬁtted values, that is, it is a standard deviation. It is independent of sample size, whereas the standard errors of the estimates for the model parameters will decrease with increasing sample size. Such a standard error of the estimate of $\sigma$, however, is not given in the summary output. Note that, by using Bayesian methods, we could easily obtain the standard error of the estimated $\sigma$ by calculating the standard deviation of the posterior distribution of $\sigma$. The $R^2$ and the adjusted $R^2$ are explained in Section == "Posterior Predictive Model Checking and Proportion of Explained Variance"==.

## Regression Variants: ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Multiple Regression

### One-Way ANOVA
The aim of analysis of variance (ANOVA) is to compare means of an outcome variable y between different groups (categorical variables). To do so in the frequentist’s framework, variances between and within the groups are compared (hence the name “analysis of variance”). If the variance between the group means is larger than expected by chance , we reject the null hypothesis of no differences between the groups. When doing an ANOVA in a Bayesian way, inference is based on the posterior distributions of the group means and the differences between the group means.

One-way ANOVA means that we only have one explanatory variable (a factor). We illustrate the one-way ANOVA based on an example of simulated data (Fig. \@ref(fig:figanova)). We have measured weights of 30 virtual individuals for each of 3 groups. Possible research questions could be: How big are the differences between the group means? Are individuals from group 2 heavier than the ones from group 1? Which group mean is higher than 7.5 g?


```r
# settings for the simulation
set.seed(626436)
b0 <- 12        # mean of group 1 (reference group)
sigma <- 2      # residual standard deviation
b1 <- 3         # difference between group 1 and group 2
b2 <- -5        # difference between group 1 and group 3
n <- 90         # sample size

# generate data
group <- factor(rep(c("group 1","group 2", "group 3"), each=30))
simresid <- rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=sigma)  # simulate residuals
y <- b0 + 
  as.numeric(group=="group 2") * b1 + 
  as.numeric(group=="group 3") * b2 + 
  simresid
dat <- tibble(y, group)

# make figure
dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = y)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange") +
  labs(y = "Weight (g)", x = "") +
  ylim(0, NA)
```

An ANOVA is a linear regression with a categorical predictor variable instead of a continuous one. The categorical predictor variable with $k$ levels is (as a default in R) transformed to $k-1$ indicator variables. An indicator variable is a binary variable containing 0 and 1 where 1 indicates a speciﬁc level (a category of a nominal variable). Often, one indicator variable is constructed for every level except for the reference level. In our example, the categorical variable is group ($g$) with the three levels "group 1", "group 2", and "group 3" ($k = 3$). Group 1 is taken as the reference level, and for each of the other two groups an indicator variable is constructed, $I(g_i = 2)$ and $I(g_i = 3)$. We can write the model as a formula:

\begin{align} 
  \mu_i &=\beta_0 + \beta_1 I(g_i=2) + \beta_1 I(g_i=3) \\
  y_i &\sim Norm(\mu_i, \sigma^2)
  (\#eq:anova)
\end{align}

where $yi$ is the $i$-th observation (weight measurement for individual i in our example), and $\beta_{0,1,2}$ are the model coefﬁcients. The residual variance is $\sigma^2$. The model coefﬁcients $\beta_{0,1,2}$ constitute the deterministic part of the model. From the model formula it follows that the group means, $m_g$, are:

\begin{align} 
  m_1 &=\beta_0 \\
  m_2 &=\beta_0 + \beta_1 \\
  m_3 &=\beta_0 + \beta_2 \\
  (\#eq:anovamw)
\end{align}

There are other possibilities to describe three group means with three parameters, for example:

\begin{align} 
  m_1 &=\beta_1 \\
  m_2 &=\beta_2 \\
  m_3 &=\beta_3 \\
  (\#eq:anovamwalt)
\end{align}

In this case, the model formula would be:

\begin{align} 
  \mu_i &= \beta_1 I(g_i=1) + \beta_2 I(g_i=2) + \beta_3 I(g_i=3) \\
  y_i &\sim Norm(\mu_i, \sigma^2)
  (\#eq:anovaalt)
\end{align}

The way the group means are described is called the parameterization of the model. Different statistical softwares use different parameterizations. The parameterization used by R by default is the one shown in Equation \@ref(eq:anova). R automatically takes the ﬁrst level as the reference (the ﬁrst level is the ﬁrst one alphabetically unless the user deﬁnes a different order for the levels). The mean of the ﬁrst group (i.e., of the ﬁrst factor level) is the intercept, $b_0$ , of the model. The mean of another factor level is obtained by adding, to the intercept, the estimate of the corresponding parameter (which is the difference from the reference group mean). R calls this parameterization "treatment contrasts".

The parameterization of the model is deﬁned by the model matrix. In the case of a one-way ANOVA, there are as many columns in the model matrix as there are factor levels (i.e., groups); thus there are k factor levels and k model coefﬁcients. Recall from Equation \@ref(eq:lmmatrix) that for each observation, the entry in the $j$-th column of the model matrix is multiplied by the $j$-th element of the model coefﬁcients and the $k$ products are summed to obtain the ﬁtted values. For a data set with $n = 5$ observations of which the ﬁrst two are from group 1, the third from group 2, and the last two from group 3, the model matrix used for the parameterization described in Equation \@ref(eq:anovamw) is

\begin{align} 
\boldsymbol{X}=
\begin{pmatrix} 
      1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
      1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
      1 & 1 & 0 \\ 
      1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
      1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{align} 

If parameterization of Equation \@ref(eq:anovamwalt) were used,

\begin{align} 
\boldsymbol{X}=
\begin{pmatrix} 
      1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
      1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
      0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
      0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
      0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{align} 

Other possibilities of model parameterizations, particularly for ordered factors, are introduced in Section \@ref(orderedfactors).

To obtain the parameter estimates for model parameterized according to Equation \@ref(eq:anovamw) we ﬁt the model in R:


```r
# fit the model
mod <- lm(y~group)  

# parameter estimates 
mod
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ group)
## 
## Coefficients:
##  (Intercept)  groupgroup 2  groupgroup 3  
##       12.367         2.215        -5.430
```

```r
summary(mod)$sigma
```

```
## [1] 1.684949
```

The "Intercept" is $\beta_0$. The other coefﬁcients are named with the factor name ("group") and the factor level (either "group 2" or "group 3"). These are $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ , respectively. Before drawing conclusions from an R output we need to examine whether the model assumptions are met, that is, we need to do a residual analysis as described in Chapter \@ref(residualanalysis).

Different questions can be answered using the above ANOVA: What are the group means? What is the difference in the means between group 1 and group 2? What is the difference between the means of the heaviest and lightest group? In a Bayesian framework we can directly assess how strongly the data support the hypothesis that the mean of the group 2 is larger than the mean of group 1. We ﬁrst simulate from the posterior distribution of the model parameters.


```r
library(arm)
nsim <- 1000
bsim <- sim(mod, n.sim=nsim)
```

Then we obtain the posterior distributions for the group means according to the parameterization of the model formula (Equation \@ref(eq:anovamw)).


```r
m.g1 <- coef(bsim)[,1]  
m.g2 <- coef(bsim)[,1] + coef(bsim)[,2] 
m.g3 <- coef(bsim)[,1] + coef(bsim)[,3] 
```

The histograms of the simulated values from the posterior distributions of the three means are given in Fig. \@ref(fig:figanovares). The three means are well separated and, based on our data, we are conﬁdent that the group means differ. From these simulated posterior distributions we obtain the means and use the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles as limits of the 95% credible intervals (Fig. \@ref(fig:figanovares), right).


```r
# save simulated values from posterior distribution in  tibble
post <- 
  tibble(`group 1` = m.g1, `group 2` = m.g2, `group 3` = m.g3) %>% 
  gather("groups", "Group means") 

# histograms per group
leftplot <- 
  ggplot(post, aes(x = `Group means`, fill = groups)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 0.5, col = "black") +
  labs(y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.title = element_blank())

# plot mean and 95%-CrI
rightplot <- 
  post %>% 
  group_by(groups) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean = mean(`Group means`),
    CrI_lo = quantile(`Group means`, probs = 0.025),
    CrI_up = quantile(`Group means`, probs = 0.975)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = groups, y = mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CrI_lo, ymax = CrI_up), width = 0.1) +
  ylim(0, NA) +
  labs(y = "Weight (g)", x ="")

multiplot(leftplot, rightplot, cols = 2)
```

</div>

To obtain the posterior distribution of the difference between the means of group 1 and group 2, we simply calculate this difference for each draw from the joint posterior distribution of the group means.


```r
d.g1.2 <- m.g1 - m.g2
mean(d.g1.2)
```

```
## [1] -2.209551
```

```r
quantile(d.g1.2, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
```

```
##      2.5%     97.5% 
## -3.128721 -1.342693
```

The estimated difference is -2.2095511. We are 95% sure that the difference between the means of group 1 and 2 is between -3.1287208 and -1.3426929.

How strongly do the data support the hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is larger than the mean of group 1? To answer this question we calculate the proportion of the draws from the joint posterior distribution for which the mean of group 2 is larger than the mean of group 1.


```r
sum(m.g2 > m.g1) / nsim 
```

```
## [1] 1
```

This means that in all of the 1000 simulations from the joint posterior distribution, the mean of group 2 was larger than the mean of group 1. Therefore, there is a very high probability (i.e., it is close to 1; because probabilities are never exactly 1, we write >0.999) that the mean of group 2 is larger than the mean of group 1.



### Other variants of normal linear models: Two-way anova, analysis of covariance and multiple regression

### Partial coefficients and some comments on collinearity

Many biologists think that it is forbidden to include correlated predictor variables in a model. They use variance inflating factors (VIF) to omit some of the variables. However, omitting important variables from the model just because a correlation coefficient exceeds a threshold value can have undesirable effects. Here, we explain why and we present the usefulness and limits of partial coefficients (also called partial correlation or partial effects). We start with an example illustrating the usefulness of partial coefficients and then, give some guidelines on how to assess and deal with collinearity.


As an example, we look at hatching dates of Snowfinches and how these dates relate to the date when snow melt started defined as the first date in the season when a minimum of 5% ground is snow free. A thorough analyses of the data is presented by @Schano.2021. An important question is how well can Snowfinches adjust their hatching dates to the snow conditions. Snowfinch nestlings grow faster when they are reared during the snow melt compared to after snow has completely melted, because their parents find nutrient rich insect larvae in the edges of melting snow patches. 



```r
load("RData/snowfinch_hatching_date.rda")

# Pearson's correlation coefficient
cor(datsf$elevation, datsf$meltstart, use = "pairwise.complete")
```

```
## [1] 0.3274635
```

```r
mod <- lm(meltstart~elevation, data=datsf)
100*coef(mod)[2] # change in meltstart with 100m change in elevation
```

```
## elevation 
##   2.97768
```

Hatching dates of Snowfinch broods were inferred from citizen science data from the Alps, where snow melt starts later at higher elevations compared to lower elevations. Thus, the start of snow melt is correlated with elevation (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.33). In average, snow starts melting 3 days later with every 100m increase in elevation. 



```r
mod1 <- lm(hatchday.mean~meltstart, data=datsf)
mod1
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = hatchday.mean ~ meltstart, data = datsf)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)    meltstart  
##   167.99457      0.06325
```

From a a normal linear regression of hatching date on the snow melt date, we obtain an estimate of 0.06 days delay in hatching date with one day later snow melt. This effect sizes describes what we see in the data, i.e. for data collected along an elevational gradient. Along the elevational gradient there are other factors than the start of snow melt that change such as average temperature, air pressure or sun radiation, and that may have an influence on the birds decision to start breeding. However, we are interested in the correlation between hatching date and date of snow melt independent of other factors changing with elevation. In other words, we would like to measure how much in average hatching date delays when snow melt starts one day later while all other factors are kept constant. This is called the partial effect of snow melt date. Therefore, we include elevation as a covariate in the model.  



```r
library(arm)
mod <- lm(hatchday.mean~elevation + meltstart, data=datsf)
mod
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = hatchday.mean ~ elevation + meltstart, data = datsf)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)    elevation    meltstart  
##  154.383936     0.007079     0.037757
```


From this model, we obtain an estimate of 0.04 days delay in hatching date with one day later snow melt at a given elevation. We further get an estimate of 0.71 days later hatching date for each 100m shift in elevation. The difference in hatching date between early and late years (around one month difference in snow melt date) at a given elevation is 1.13 days (Figure \@ref(fig:sfexfig)).

The correlation between hatching date and start of snow melt date we estimate in the first model (black regression line in Figure \@ref(fig:sfexfig)), that does not include elevation, is called "pseudocorrelation" because its is not purely "caused" by the date of snow melt. When we estimate the correlation within a constant elevation (coloured regression lines), it is much lower and closer to a causal relationship. However, in such observational studies, we never can be sure whether the partial coefficients can be interpreted as a causal relationship unless we include all factors that influence hatching date. Nevertheless, partial effects give much more insight into a system compared to univariate analyses because we can separated effects of simultaneously acting variables.

We have seen that it can be very useful to include more than one predictor variable in a model even if they are correlated with each other. In fact, there is nothing wrong with that. However, correlated predictors (collinearity) make things more complicated. 

For example, partial regression lines should not be drawn across the whole range of values of a variable, to avoid extrapolating out of data. At 2800 m asl snow melt never starts in the beginning of March. Therefore, the blue regression line would not make sense for snow melt dates in March.

Further, sometimes correlations among predictors indicate that these predictors measure the same underlying aspect and we are actually interested in the effect of this underlying aspect on our response. For example, we could include also the date of the end of snow melt. Both variables, the start and the end of the snow melt measure the timing of snow melt. Including both as predictor in the model would result in partial coefficients that measure how much hatching date changes when the snow melt starts one day later, while the end date is constant. That interpretation is a mixture of the effect of timing and duration rather than of snow melt timing alone. Similarly, the coefficient of the end of snow melt measures a mixture of duration and timing. Thus, if we include two variables that are correlated because they measure the same aspect (just a little bit differently), we get coefficients that are hard to interpret and may not measure what we actually are interested in. In such a cases, we get easier to interpret model coefficients, if we include just one variable of each aspect that we are interested in, e.g. we could include one timing variable (e.g. start of snow melt) and the duration of snow melt that may or may not be correlated with the start of snow melt.   
To summarize, the decision of what to do with correlated predictors primarily relies on the question we are interested in, i.e., what exactly should the partial coefficients be an estimate for. 

A further drawback of collinearity is that model fitting can become difficult. When strong correlations are present, model fitting algorithms may fail. If they do not fail, the statistical uncertainty of the estimates often becomes large. This is because the partial coefficient of one variable needs to be estimated for constant values of the other predictors in the model which means that a reduced range of values is available as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:sfexfig) C. However, if uncertainty intervals (confidence, credible or compatibility intervals) are reported alongside the estimates, then using correlated predictors in the same model is absolutely fine, if the fitting algorithm was successful.

The correlations per se can be interesting. Further readings on how to visualize and analyse data with complex correlation structures:
