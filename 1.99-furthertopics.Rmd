# Further topics {#furthertopics}

This is a collection of short introductions or links with commented R code that cover other topics that might be useful for ecologists.

## Bioacoustic analyse
Bioacoustic analyses are nicely covered in a blog by [Marcelo Araya-Salas](https://marce10.github.io).

## Python {#python}
Like R, python is a high-level programming language that is used by many ecologists. The [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. 

## Some R



t.x.lab <- as.Date(paste0(c("1.1","1.3","1.5","1.7","1.9","1.11","31.12"),".2024"),format="%d.%m.%Y")
t.x.lab2 <- paste(as.numeric(format(t.x.lab,"%d")),as.numeric(format(t.x.lab,"%m")),sep=".")
plot(as.Date(c("01.01.2024","21.05.2024","22.12.2024","31.12.2024"),format="%d.%m.%Y"),c(3,2,6,5), xaxt="n",
     xlab="Date",ylab="Detection")
axis(1,t.x.lab,t.x.lab2,gap.axis = 0)
